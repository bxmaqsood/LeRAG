When I saw a car on my left front backing up, I pressed on the brake pedal immediately and turned the wheel slightly to the right. All of a sudden, the Tesla accelerated on its own with a very strong force and high speed, with the wheel turned sharply on its own toward the right. The Tesla then run through the steel fence of the parking lot, flying past the sidewalk, and finally settled on top of a big rock on the ground (which is placed there to protect the supermarket building). All of these happened so fast with such a strong force and all in an unintended manner. I was not injured and luckily no other persons or vehicles were involved. However, the vehicle was totalled and there were damage of the supermarket property.",

    "summary": "A little background information, on Dec 2023 I installed 4 new Hankook Ion Evo AS (255/45R19) for my Tesla model Y at the Correa Tire shop in Dorado Puerto Rico and the manufacture date on those tires was 4422 and at the time the car had close to 30k miles. On April 2025 one of the tires broke and I replaced it at the same place with the same tire model. Less than a month after the new tire was installed, while riding on the highway at close to 65mph the recently replaced tire completely broke off leaving only the sides and the rest of the tire flew off the car (see pictures attached). This happened suddenly with no previous indication or car notification of any issue with the tire. Fortunately, I was able to stop the car without losing control and apparently the tire did not hit other oncoming cars. This was a very scary situation, which could have resulted on a serous and even fatal accident. When I checked the new tire, or what remained of it, I noticed it had the same manufacturing date (4422) as the tires I had replaced in 2023. The next day I went to the tire shop and explained the incident and they informed I had to buy a new tire while they investigated the situation and if there was any issue with the tire. At that time I also opened a complaint with Hankook US. After waiting various weeks for a response, and expecting reimbursement for the damage tire, I have not received any information from the tire shop and Hankook said they did not receive a claim from the tire shop.",

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 While reversing in this 2021 Tesla Model Y (software v12, 2025.14.1, Full Self-Driving Supervised), the vehicle\u2019s ultrasonic sensors showed a wall directly behind on the display. However, the Tesla Vision camera system did not visually render the wall, and neither Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) nor Obstacle-Aware Acceleration activated. The car reversed under driver input directly into the wall, causing a collision with property damage. The safety defect appears to be that the ultrasonic sensors, although still present and visually displayed, are no longer integrated into the collision avoidance systems after Tesla\u2019s software updates activating Tesla Vision. As a result, the AEB and OAA systems seem to rely only on camera data, ignoring ultrasonic sensor input \u2014 leaving a dangerous blind spot in reverse. This problem affects safety because the driver receives no warning that AEB or OAA will not engage based on ultrasonic detection alone. Tesla\u2019s updated owner manuals (2023.12) state that AEB is now designed to work in reverse, but in this case, the system failed. The issue has not yet been inspected by Tesla or a dealer but appears reproducible on vehicles with ultrasonic sensors running Tesla Vision software. This is likely a widespread defect affecting 2020\u20132022 Tesla Model 3, Y, S, and X vehicles equipped with ultrasonic sensors but updated via software. There were no warning lights or system alerts before the failure. I request NHTSA investigate whether Tesla\u2019s software has disabled or failed to integrate ultrasonic sensor data into rear collision avoidance, creating an undisclosed safety risk for owners.",

Despite my efforts to address this matter directly with Tesla, their response has been dismissive, prioritizing an out-of-pocket repair fee over a fundamental safety concern. Recently, my [XXX] son discovered that rear driver side seat belt does not latch onto the buckle. When I contacted Tesla to seek assistance in resolving this issue, I was informed I would need to pay out of pocket to replace the buckle because my warranty had expired as of January this year. During the replacement, the Tesla technician pointed out that the other 2 seat belt buckles in the back seat were also defective and would soon not function properly. The Tesla service center in Alhambra, CA was notified but they categorized it as a customer-pay repair. An expired warranty should not absolve Tesla of responsibility for a defect in a critical safety component. Seat belts are essential for driver and passenger protection, and any failure in their function could lead to serious injury or fatality. I am deeply concerned that Tesla does not seem to be taking this issue seriously. Instead of addressing the safety risk posed by the defective seat belts, their response has been to demand payment for a repair that should not be the driver's financial burden. Safety should always be the top priority, and I believe Tesla\u2019s handling of this matter is unacceptable. I urge your office to investigate this issue further to ensure that Tesla is held accountable for addressing potential defects in their seat belts. If Tesla is unwilling to resolve this matter appropriately, I believe regulatory intervention is necessary to protect consumers from similar safety risks.

    "summary": "This report addresses concerns regarding recent safety updates in the Tesla Model Y, specifically focusing on the \"Rear Cross Traffic Alert\" and the blind spot warning system. These updates are intended to enhance driver awareness and prevent collisions. However, there are significant shortcomings in their current implementation that may compromise driver safety. 1. Rear Cross Traffic Alert: Intended Functionality: The \"Rear Cross Traffic Alert\" is designed to warn drivers of approaching vehicles from the side when reversing, thereby preventing potential collisions. Current Implementation: The system currently highlights a portion of the infotainment screen in red when a potential hazard is detected. There is no accompanying audible alert to notify the driver of the danger. Safety Concerns: Drivers are likely to be looking over their shoulder or at their mirrors while reversing, rather than at the infotainment screen. The lack of an audible alert means that drivers may not notice the visual warning, especially if their attention is directed away from the screen. This could lead to an increased risk of collision, as the visual cue alone may not be sufficient to capture the driver's attention. 2. Blind Spot Warning System: Intended Functionality: The blind spot warning system is designed to alert drivers of vehicles in their blind spot when the turn signal is activated, helping to prevent lane-change collisions. Current Implementation: Similar to the Rear Cross Traffic Alert, the system highlights the screen in red when a vehicle is detected in the blind spot. No audible warning is provided to alert the driver. Safety Concerns: In adverse weather conditions, such as rain, drivers may rely more heavily on blind spot warnings due to reduced visibility. Drivers typically turn their heads to check for vehicles, which means they may not see the screen's visual alert. Without an audible warning, drivers may inadvertently change lanes into an occupied space, increas",

    "summary": "This complaint addresses the recent changes made to the cruise control system in Tesla vehicles, as per NHTSA guidance in 2024. While the update aims to simplify the activation of enhanced cruise control, it introduces significant disadvantages and safety risks that need to be addressed. 1. Cruise Control Activation Update: NHTSA Guidance: In 2024, Tesla was required to modify the activation process for enhanced cruise control, allowing it to be engaged with a single pull when the option is selected. There are two options available: single pull and double pull. Advantages: \uf0b7 The update simplifies the process, enabling users to activate enhanced cruise control with a single pull, which is more convenient and user-friendly. Disadvantages: \uf0b7 When the enhanced cruise control is activated and the turn signal is engaged, the system automatically deactivates. \uf0b7 This deactivation causes the vehicle to stop maintaining its set speed, leading to a slowdown or complete stop. 2. Safety Risks: Driver Reaction: \uf0b7 The sudden deactivation of cruise control requires drivers to quickly move their feet back to the gas pedal to maintain speed. \uf0b7 This is particularly concerning when attempting to change lanes or merge into tight spaces, where maintaining speed is crucial for safety. Loss of Safety Features: \uf0b7 Upon deactivation of the enhanced cruise control, the vehicle no longer maintains a safe following distance, transferring full control back to the driver. \uf0b7 This abrupt transition means that the driver is left without the system's assistance to ensure safe driving and timely reactions, potentially increasing the risk of collisions. Increased Driver Workload: \uf0b7 Drivers must frequently reactivate cruise control after changing lanes, which demands additional effort and diverts attention from the road. \uf0b7 This constant need to manage the cruise control system can lead to driver distraction and increased cognitive load, potentially compromising road safety. 3.

    "summary": "On [XXX], our 2021 Tesla Model Y had a catastrophic suspension failure while driving in live traffic. The car came to a sudden stop, the front suspension was loose and the vehicle was not drivable. We had the vehicle towed to the nearest Testa service center in Burlingame, CA. Tesla service center inspected the car and found that the lower lateral links in the front suspension had failed due to two critical suspension bolts falling out. One bolt had completely fallen out and the other had became dangerously loose and was about to fall out. The bolt failures led to a catastrophic failure of the front suspension and the vehicle became undrivable in live traffic. This is a low mileage vehicle with ~29,500 miles and there was no operator error or use that would cause a catastrophic bolt failure in the lower lateral links. Images of the issue from Tesla service center show that the bolts simply fell out after not being sufficiently fastened from the manufacturer. After Tesla service center identified the problem, we researched this issue and found an extremely relevant NHTSA recall for 2020-2021 Model Y vehicles that matches the exact suspension issue that occurred to us (21V-835 / SB-21-31-003 Recall). Our Model Y was built in November 2020, which is within the affected date range of this Recall, and our issue exactly matches this Recall. Tesla service center employees agreed this Recall seemed relevant and investigated. After a couple of days, Tesla service center contacted us and claimed that while the our catastrophic suspension issue looked very similar to the Recall issue mentioned above, our specific VIN was not listed in the Recall. Therefore, Tesla service center refused to repair the failure under warranty or recall and we were stuck with massive repair bill to fix a clear manufacturer defect that is already known and has been recalled. We are not sure why our VIN was not captured in Recall, but have been affected by the same dangerous issue.

One side of the car was dropped to the ground. When he got out, he saw the front of the car's bottom was scrapping on the ground. He realized it was a critical error. The suspension on the right side fell to the ground, and two brand new bolts fell on the ground a little behind the car. Right front tire was twisted and pointed to the opposite direction of the other wheel. Neither of the wheels were parallel. The front tire was scratched with some deep marks because it's been scrapping and dragging on the ground. The twisted tire damaged the side of the front right fender because it was out of place.

As a Tesla owner who has previously filed multiple complaints about this issue, I am deeply concerned and frustrated by the lack of resolution to this potentially life-threatening problem. Today, I experienced a terrifying phantom braking event that nearly resulted in a catastrophic accident. I was driving on a completely empty road with no traffic in sight - no vehicles behind me, none in front, and none approaching from any direction. Suddenly, without any apparent trigger, my Tesla aggressively applied the brakes, violently decelerating from approximately 25 mph to just 3 mph in a matter of seconds. This abrupt and unnecessary braking action caught me entirely off guard. The force of the deceleration threw me forward, and I narrowly avoided losing control of the vehicle. Had there been any traffic behind me, I have no doubt this incident would have resulted in a severe rear-end collision. The frequency and unpredictability of these phantom braking events make me feel unsafe every time I get behind the wheel. It\u2019s only a matter of time before one of these incidents leads to a serious accident or fatality. Despite multiple reports to both Tesla and NHTSA, this critical safety issue remains unresolved. I implore NHTSA to take immediate and decisive action to address this problem. The safety of Tesla drivers, their passengers, and other road users is at stake. Please investigate this issue thoroughly and compel Tesla to implement a permanent fix for the phantom braking problem.

    "summary": "Tesla released a feature called Obstacle Aware Acceleration. The Owner's Manual states: \"Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to reduce the impact of a collision by reducing motor torque and in some cases applying the brakes, if Model Y detects an object in its driving path. The touchscreen displays a visual warning and sounds a chime when the brakes are automatically applied. For example, Model Y, while parked in front of a closed garage door with Drive engaged, detects that you have pressed hard on the accelerator pedal. Although Model Y still accelerates and hits the garage door, the reduced torque may result in less damage. Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to operate only when all of these conditions are simultaneously met: Drive or Reverse is engaged. Model Y is stopped or traveling less than 10 mph (16 km/h). Model Y detects an object in its immediate driving path.\" However, my vehicle (and at least some other Model Y Performance models) do not behave in this manner. Rather than reducing motor torque when all of the above conditions have been met, it reduces torque every time the vehicle accelerates from a stop. This has been replicated by my local Tesla Service Center, and they confirmed the vehicle did not detect any objects in it's path. This is dangerous because the vehicle accelerates so slowly from a stop that I may not be able to avoid an accident if the vehicle doesn't accelerate as expected.",

    "summary": "Twice, while in full self-driving mode on I-395, my Tesla has made the potentially fatal mistake of trying to turn the vehicle directly into the closed gates of the so-called \"hot lanes\" (which separate the north and sound bound lanes) and into on-coming highway traffic on those lanes. This is a serious safety issue that must be fixed IMMEDIATELY. This happened most recently on Sunday October 20, 2024, when I was driving south-bound on I-395 with my wife and son in the car. I was in the far left lane with \"full self driving\" activated. The hot lanes were to our left with all traffic on those lanes driving northbound. The gates to the hot lanes were closed to southbound traffic to prevent someone from driving directly into oncoming traffic. Shortly before we were about to pass those closed gates, the Tesla left indicator light came on and the car began to turn. The map showed the car was trying to turn us directly into the closed gates and oncoming traffic. Fortunately, I was paying close attention to this potential problem because the identical thing had happened previously, during the prior 30 day period when full self-driving was made available for free to all Tesla owners in April 2024. On that weekday evening, I was my driving my son northbound on I-395 after his basketball practice. The hot lanes were running southbound. Once again, as I approached the closed hot lane gates, the left indicator light came on as the car prepared to drive us through the closed gates and into the on-coming hot lane traffic. I am not a Tesla critic. I really like the car, but please address this issue ASAP before somebody gets killed.",

    "summary": "while driving on the NJ Turnpike I heard a large \"pop\" noise. Shortly after as I was on the Exit 7A exit ramp I lost all power steering. I nearly hit the guardrail before the car came to a complete stop. I was able to maneuver the car off the exit ramp and pulled over. The was an error message appeared on the screen indicating \"power steering reduced.\" It wasn't reduced it was non-existent. The car was flat bedded to the Tesla service center and a week later the car repair was completed. The service center indicated it was the \"steering rack\" broke. Although I don't know exactly what that means, even the service center admitted that this failure should not have occurred. The car is 2 1/2 years old with 90k miles. It is out of warranty so i was responsible for payment. The reason for my complaint is that a catastrophic failure in the steering rack should not happen on a 2 1/2 year old car.",

I was not given the opportunity to accept or refuse this particular feature. While both of these events feel wrong to me, it did not rise to the level of reporting to NHTSA until I realized Tesla had also ENABLED FSD on my car. In other words they switched my configuration from Auto Pilot to Full Self Drive, presumably as part of the software update that downloaded the software on to my vehicle. One could argue that because two features on my screen were different I was able to figure out my configuration had changed, and manually change it back. One could also argue that not everyone would sort this out, and the next time they pulled the stalk down to engage cruise control they would unknowingly engage FSD. And that is not OK.

    "summary": "I am writing to file a formal complaint against Tesla, regarding a significant issue with my Tesla Model Y 2021, which I purchased in December last year. This matter pertains to false advertising and a failure to uphold the promised capabilities of the vehicle. Despite Tesla's advertising and product descriptions promising a range of 330 miles on a full charge, my car has consistently achieved at least 40% less than this advertised range. This drastic shortfall has severely impacted the vehicle's usability and the value I derive from it. I scheduled a service appointment with Tesla. The resolution proposed by the service team was both shocking and unacceptable. They suggested that to achieve the advertised range, I would need to disable the vehicle's cameras. This advice is not only impractical but also negates one of the key safety features of the car. There was no disclosure at the point of sale that the use of standard vehicle features, such as the cameras, would so drastically reduce the car's range. To suggest disabling a critical feature to achieve the advertised performance is misleading and diminishes the value and functionality of the vehicle. Feeling deceived by Tesla, as the product delivered does not meet the specifications and capabilities that were advertised, I am seeking a resolution to this matter. I propose the following options: 1-A technical fix to the car that allows it to achieve the advertised 330-mile range without disabling any safety or standard features. 2-Complimentary access to Tesla's Supercharger network 3-A full refund for the vehicle, allowing me to return the car.",

However, many individuals reported that the recall immediately and irreversibly damaged their DAS computer, so Tesla offered them a free replacement without hassle. However, I have been struggling to work with Tesla's Carlsbad, California service center for over a week to get the DAS computer replaced at no cost, since the computer was damaged after an update caused the computer to become irreversibly damaged after their software update was installed -- a software update which was supposed to have made the Autopilot system safer, but which has instead unfortunately irreversibly damaged the Autopilot computer, and caused my vehicle to randomly and immediately weave towards a highway barrier at high speed.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 1. Under certain circumstances, the vehicle is able to decelerate using its regenerative braking system without illuminating the brake lights. This occurs during \"one pedal driving\" where the operator is driving only using the throttle to both accelerate and decelerate the car, without the input of mechanical brakes. This is a programming issue, not a mechanical issue. The brake lights are \"triggered\" when the car decelerates at a threshold of -0.1G or greater. At anything less than -0.1G, the lights will not turn on. This drastically increases the risk of a rear-end collision. 2. Under the right conditions the operator could decelerate from a speed of 45 mph to 5 mph without the brake lights ever coming on, not until they reach a near-complete-stop. This poses a high risk to all drivers that are behind the vehicle, and fails to give warning to other drivers. It should never be possible for this to occur. 3. This problem has been in discussion on Tesla owner's forums; specifically \"Tesla Motors Club\". (see attached posts) Tesla has the highest accident rate, and no one has yet figured out why. A typical internal combustion vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission coast-down decelerates at an average rate of -0.02G. The Tesla's regen brake light turn-on threshold of -0.1G is 5X more than the deceleration of a typical coasting ICE car (-0.02G) . For slow-downs between -0.02G and -0.1G, where the Tesla's deceleration exceeds an ICE car by up to 5X, there is no warning to other drivers, as the brake lights will not turn on. Any braking force above -0.02G of deceleration exceeds that of an ICE car, and should be made-known via the brake-lights. I hope that this is not overlooked; it is extremely important for this to be addressed to reduce rear-end collisions involving EV's. 99%+ of vehicles in the USA are ICE, and do not coast-down at a rate of -0.1G. The brake lights must indicate this above-normal reduction in speed.",

    "summary": "Subject: Safety Concerns Regarding Recent Model y Autopilot Update To Whom It May Concern at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), I am writing to urgently express my concerns about the latest software update for the Tesla Model Y\u2019s autopilot system, which, in my view, significantly compromises safety. As a Model 3 owner for over one year, I have generally found the vehicle and its features to be reliable and safe. However, the recent update has introduced an overly stringent hands-on-wheel detection mechanism that is not only inconvenient but also potentially hazardous. The new update requires frequent and often forceful interaction with the steering wheel to assure the system of driver presence. This change is drastically different from my previous experience, where I received only one hands-on-wheel violation in two years. The current sensitivity of the system disrupts the smooth operation of the autopilot, leading to frequent and abrupt disengagements. I have found myself struggling to maintain the system\u2019s activation, inadvertently causing the vehicle to exit autopilot mode multiple times. This issue goes beyond mere inconvenience; it actively detracts from driving safety. The need for constant and sometimes aggressive adjustments to satisfy the system\u2019s requirements is distracting and can lead to erratic vehicle behavior. The irony is stark: a system designed to enhance driving safety and ease is now a source of potential danger and stress. The unpredictability and over-sensitivity of the updated system could lead to dangerous situations, especially on highways or in heavy traffic, where sudden disengagement of the autopilot can be particularly risky. As a driver, I now find myself more focused on keeping the autopilot engaged than on the actual driving conditions and surroundings, which is surely contrary to the feature\u2019s intended purpose. Thank you for your prompt attention to this serious safety concern. Sincerely, [XXX] INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

Not a single warning and this was the first time that this has happened to my vehicle. I was driving using auto drive at 75 MPH on highway at 8:45AM on 11/18/2023. All of a sudden, and for no reason, my Tesla Model Y slowed down within 3 seconds to around 45 MPH. This was completely unexpected as no other car, debris, person was near me. When I got. home that day, I read about phantom breaking with the Tesla. What happened to my car is yet another example of phantom breaking.

    "summary": "To the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a recent experience with my 2021 Tesla Model Y, which is still under warranty. While using the vehicle, I observed an abnormal sound when reversing. After seeking Tesla\u2019s service, I was informed that the rotors on my car needed replacement. What greatly concerns me is that, despite the car being under warranty, Tesla charged me an amount of one thousand dollars for this repair. It is essential to note that this malfunction wasn\u2019t due to any negligence or external factors on my part. I have video evidence that captures the sound the vehicle made while reversing, further emphasizing the unexpected nature of this issue. My understanding of the warranty terms led me to believe that such unforeseen defects should be covered without any additional charges. It is deeply unsettling to be presented with such a significant expense for a problem that, in my view, should have been resolved under the warranty\u2019s purview. I am reaching out to the NHTSA to shed light on this matter, as it brings forth concerns about the potential for similar experiences faced by other Tesla Model Y owners. I request the NHTSA\u2019s assistance in investigating this incident to ensure consumers like myself are not unduly burdened with unjustified costs. Your attention to this matter is highly appreciated. I am hopeful for a just resolution that aligns with the NHTSA\u2019s dedication to safeguarding consumers and ensuring vehicular safety standards.

In our specific case, no such warning was given, resulting in the vehicle becoming inoperative. This situation could pose a significant safety hazard if the car had stopped in the middle of the road. On September 12, 2023, my son experienced an incident where he could open the driver's side door, but the dashboard screen went completely blank. Despite attempting to reboot the system, there was no response. After exiting the car and closing the door, we observed that the window did not behave as expected in typical situations, as it did not slide down when the door was closed. This unexpected malfunction led to the window breaking without any prior indication or warning from Tesla. The absence of any alert regarding this electrical failure is concerning, especially considering the potential danger if such an incident occurs on a busy highway. Regrettably, Tesla's service center has firmly asserted that the vehicle is no longer covered under warranty and has declined to provide any assistance or resolution for this issue.",

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries1 Deaths0 On Wednesday, our 2021 Tesla Y - which we have LOVED driving for the last 3 years - took off on its own while I was sitting in traffic - where traffic was at a standstill, and the max speed was probably 4 MPH. Construction ahead had closed a lane, so there was a massive back-up and cars were creeping along each time the traffic light ahead turned green.) As any Tesla owner will tell you, the best way to slow down is to remove your foot from the gas pedal, and the car will slow down and come to a stop on its own. That had always been the case for our vehicle until Wednesday. Shockingly, for no reason at all, the car massively accelerated. I slammed on the brakes, but the brakes did not slow or stop the car. Luckily, the car in front of me was only 2 - 3 car lengths away, so my Tesla which was rapidly gaining speed stopped only when it crashed into that car. I have relatively minor injuries, but I am sure I would have been killed and/or killed others if not for the vehicle in front of me forcing my car to stop. After the crash, we flat-bedded the car to a Tesla-approved auto body shop. Our insurance adjuster will be inspecting the car on Monday. We will make the vehicle available for inspection. I am still shaken from this traumatic experience. I have never had a car accident (but for a fender bender over 40 years ago). Moreover, I have spent my life working in public service (govt, elected officials and nonprofits). I am determined to make sure that this safety problem is fully investigated and repaired - as our roads are not safe until it is fixed.",

This incident has raised significant safety concerns for me and my family and requires immediate attention and resolution. The vehicle fire occurred under normal driving conditions, and thankfully, no one was injured in the incident. However, the fire resulted in substantial damage to the vehicle and posed a significant risk to nearby properties and individuals. The incident has left me shaken and worried about the safety of Tesla vehicles. I have attached the following documents and information for your reference: I have been a loyal Tesla customer and have appreciated the innovative features and benefits that your vehicles offer. However, this incident has eroded my confidence in the safety and reliability of your products. I kindly request a thorough investigation into the cause of the fire and an explanation of the circumstances that led to this incident. Additionally, I request information on any recalls, technical bulletins, or potential issues associated with the model of my vehicle. Furthermore, I urge you to take immediate action to prevent similar incidents from occurring in other vehicles. Safety should be the utmost priority for any automobile manufacturer, and I hope Tesla will take swift measures to address any potential risks. I understand that accidents can happen, but it is essential that Tesla demonstrates transparency, accountability, and a commitment to ensuring the safety of its customers. I expect to be kept informed about the progress of the investigation and any steps that will be taken to prevent future incidents.

I am writing to express my extreme concern and disappointment regarding a serious malfunction I experienced with my Tesla vehicle, Model Y, on 08/01/2023. The incident has left me deeply troubled and has raised significant questions about the safety and reliability of your vehicles. On the aforementioned date, while I was driving my Model Y, I noticed an unusual burning smell coming from the vehicle. Shortly after, the cruise control system began to malfunction erratically, leading to a loss of control over the vehicle's speed. In a matter of seconds, the display and all lights on the dashboard went dark, leaving me unable to monitor crucial information such as speed, battery level, and vehicle warnings. Worse yet, the electronic power steering suddenly failed, causing an immediate stiffening of the steering wheel and making it incredibly difficult to control the vehicle. As a result, my car veered into a curb, causing damage to the wheels and suspension and fire. I cannot stress enough how distressing this situation was. Not only did it put my safety and the safety of others at risk, but it also raises questions about the reliability and effectiveness of the various systems within the vehicle. I have always trusted Tesla's commitment to innovation and cutting-edge technology, but this incident has shattered my confidence in the vehicle's reliability. I am writing to urge you to take immediate action to investigate this malfunction thoroughly and provide a comprehensive explanation for what transpired. I request a detailed analysis of the root cause of the issue and assurance that appropriate measures will be taken to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

I also tried using the keycard to unlock the doors. I tried using my spouse's app which also didn't work. Nothing worked and my son was trapped in the car in 100+ degree weather for over 15 minutes. My husband had to pry the front passenger door open so that we can could get him out and in doing so caused the window to crack. When contacting Tesla, they sent out a tow truck to get it to the service center. They fixed the problem and told us there was a manual latch for the front and rear seats, but there was no way our two year old would have been able to pull the latch, let alone reach it. There is also no manual latch on the exterior of the car that we could have used.",

    "summary": "Approximately 11:26 am on Thursday July 27, and approximately 110 miles east of Gallup, New Mexico, I experienced when driving a 2021 Tesla Model Y, a series of extreme phantom braking events. One phantom braking event resulted in an extreme braking and the car gave a loud alarm signal. This happened while passing two rather closely spaced semi-trailer trucks that were in the right lane of the interstate highway 40 roadway going westbound. Both trucks were traveling without making any unusual movements. They were steadily traveling between 70 and 80 mph. There was a large SUV following our vehicle. This event resulted in an extremely hazardous condition. A high-speed rear-end collision was imminent. I, as the driver of the Model Y, immediately accelerated and steered over to the left-lane shoulder. No collision occurred and I was able to pass the two trucks and return to the right lane. Clearly, this behavior of the Model Y is extremely hazardous and must be corrected. It is my recollection that I had disengaged the auto steer mode prior to passing the two trucks and then reengaged the auto steer after passing the two trucks and moving to the right lane. I have experienced this behavior before as I have been driving the vehicle for the past two years of my three-year lease. Strangely it always occurs, it seems when driving on rural interstate, such as this case. Fortunately, these experiences helped me to instantly respond by accelerating and moving onto the left lane shoulder to avoid a disastrous accident. It is appalling that this has been happening. The Tesla gives absolutely no indication of the cause of the urgent breaking either before or after the event. Also there has been no notifications from Tesla on this dangerous phantom breaking. I am sending this report to Tesla and the NHTSA.",

This is because we experienced this same thing 2-3 times on another long drive in November of 2022, and Tesla service told us at the time they couldn\u2019t do anything about it unless we had time stamps because otherwise, it\u2019s too many pages of code to sort through and beyond that, you have to notify them within 12 days of the incident or they can\u2019t look into it at all (which is what happened with me- although I had to chase them to even get a response). They also said it was a \u201cknown issue\u201d but were unsure about a planned remedy. I took screenshots of that conversation with Tesla service and have attached to this submission in the event that\u2019s helpful.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 My wife was driving in moderate rain on the freeway. We were going about 70mph which was the same speed as the rest of the cars. We were going around a gentle turn in the road. Then without warning, our car started to slowly spin around. My wife instantly and completely lost control. We spun almost 180 degrees, crashed into two other vehicles, and came to rest against the cement barrier. Luckily nobody was seriously hurt, but we totaled two vehicles and damaged another. If the spin had happened along a different section of road we frequently drive on, we would have slid into oncoming traffic and people could have been killed. I requested that Tesla send the full data logs of the accident. It shows that my wife released the accelerator pedal right when the spin started. In most cars, releasing the accelerator causes the car to gently slow down. But Teslas, on the other hand, do aggressive regenerative braking when the accelerator is released. So it was as if my wife had pressed the break. HERE IS THE PROBLEM: THE REGENERATIVE BRAKING SYSTEM APPLIES THE BREAKS TO THE REAR WHEELS ONLY. On dry pavement this is fine, but on a wet road, going around a turn, hitting only the rear breaks was enough to cause the back of our car to slide out from behind us. Here is more detail: 1. Our car was All Wheel Drive. But the Tesla has published that for increased efficiency, they don't actually use the front motor except during high acceleration. This means that most of the time the car is only rear wheel drive. 2. Our car had under 25,000 miles on it, and the factory tires. The rear tires were worn more than the front tires, likely due to the car's acceleration being mostly applied to the rear tires. I believe that Tesla could fix this issue with an over-the-air recall. The recall would need to either reduce regenerative braking when wet roads are detected, or apply braking across both the front and rear wheels while on wet roads. Thank you!",

I have read in the news about the issue concerning the full AutoPilot with drivers not paying attention figuring the vehicle will drive itself.

The driver and passengers are panicked requiring the driver to immediately respond by pressing the accelerator to avoid being rear-ended. My wife and I have experienced the issue on multiple occasions since owning our Tesla Y since September 2021. We have experienced the issue on clear days with perfect weather and a clean windshield. The road is clear with no vehicles in front of us on a divided highway traveling at highway speeds. We've also experienced the issue on a two-lane non-divided road with oncoming traffic in the other lane. Eventually, the problem becomes such an issue that we have to turn-off the cruise control to drive normally which defeats the reason why cruise control is desired. I had presented the issue with Tesla support, but I was basically blown off. Although, this issue is frequently commented by other Tesla owners on social media. Basically, the Tesla cruise control does not function like any of my other car's cruise control. The problem is thus software related to how the images from the camera are interpreted.

Then the car cut its power and flashed an alert \"Power Reduced - exiting and re-entering vehicle may restore operation\" it then flashed an alert \"PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY - Unable to drive\". According to Tesla, they said it was the \"LH body harness. Found that the harness was not creating an efficient connection\" but they never directly addressed why it felt as if the car was accelerating when I pressed on the brake. Safety was critically comprised for myself and others who I could have hit in a vehicle collision since the brakes did not respond accordingly and felt as if it accelerated or continue to maintain its speed. The problem was confirmed by Tesla but they only addressed the car going into what they refer to as \"limp mode\". Car was inspected by Tesla and diagnosed the problem to a faulty/bad body harness that caused an improper signal. No warning lights or messages prior to the failure.

The plugs and door latches on both rear doors of my Tesla Model Y have failed repeatedly. The failure of the door latches and plugs has repeatedly endangered the safety of the occupants, particularly children who may be unable to exit the car in an emergency situation. The door trim falls out of place, locking the occupants in the back of the car. This problem has been reproduced and confirmed by the dealer, as evidenced by my car's multiple visits to the service center for the same issue. Attached are the documents, they are all for the same issue - though tesla classified them inconsistently. The vehicle has been inspected by the service center, but the problem has persisted despite their attempts to fix it. There were no warning indicators prior to the failure, making the problem even more dangerous as it can occur without the driver's knowledge. I am deeply concerned about this safety issue, particularly given that the 2021 Tesla Model Y is a popular vehicle that is widely used by consumers across the United States. It is vital that action is taken to address this issue and ensure that all affected vehicles are recalled and repaired. I strongly urge the NHTSA to investigate this issue and require a recall of all affected vehicles. The safety of drivers and passengers must be the top priority in the design and manufacture of all vehicles, and it is clear that the Tesla Model Y's rear door latches and plugs are failing to meet necessary standards of safety.",

    "summary": "SYSTEM MALFUNCTION: Emergency braking (\"phantom braking\") while set to automated driving/adaptive cruise control. OUR SAFETY PUT AT RISK: On a 2,000 mi. road trip from Denver CO to Tucson, AZ and back, the vehicle slammed on the brakes at 75-80 mph speeds over two dozen times. All incidents occurred either driving south on I-25 or west on I-10 going to Tucson, or on I-10 east and I-25 north on our return. By far the most dangerous event occurred when we were driving east on I-10 in SE Arizona on our return to Denver on 29 January. Driving in the right lane at 75 mph on a perfectly clear day with excellent road conditions, the vehicle suddenly slammed on its brakes. Following closely behind us was a semi-tractor-trailer, that also slammed on its brakes, blasted its horn, and very nearly rear-ended us. The truck driver then followed us at very close range for the next ten miles, If we slowed down, the truck slowed down. If we speeded up, the truck speeded up. We disengaged cruise control so we wouldn't involuntarily brake hard once more. Finally, the truck drive honked once more and dropped back as we sped up. In our view, this was an evident case of road rage on the trucker's part that might have ended tragically. REPRODUCTION OF PROBLEM: We have a 2/27/23 appointment with a Tesla service center here in Colorado to check out the automated driving/cruise control/camera and sensing system. However, this problem only arose under quite specific topographical, and road surface/light conditions on I-25 and I-10 in rural areas, so I'm doubtful Tesla service techs would be able to replicate the conditions. WARNINGS: There were no warnings emitted by the vehicle either audibly or visually (on the display screen) prior to any of these incidents.",

It was around 9pm PT and there was very light traffic. The next car in front of me was at least 100 feet ahead of me and there weren't any cars on the left or right of me. All of a sudden the car started decelerating really quickly, and by the time I pressed the accelerator to counteract the deceleration, the car was at roughly 60 MPH. There wasn't any indication as to why the car decelerated so suddenly, and there wasn't anything that I could see that might have caused the cruise control to react that way. Thankfully there wasn't a car close behind me - if there had been, it's possible that the trailing car could have hit me and caused an accident at high speeds. I've read online that there are quite a lot of reports of \"Phantom braking\" from Teslas, and from the descriptions I've read, my experience seems to be exactly the same.

This could be a really bad situation, luckily we had blankets and such to keep warm for the last few hours of the drive. I believe this was caused by an earlier TSB with sensor replacements and a software change done earlier in the life of my car for heatpump issues.

    "summary": "Regarding a Tesla Y, 2021with 10,000 miles; Durging a recent cold spell, winter driving conditions, the A/C Compressor/Heat Pump failed causing the windshield defrost to cease functioning, causing the visiblity to become poor to none at all, requiring that the vehicle not be driven on the roads until the weather cleared and even then, the driver or pasenger (if avalailbe) has to wipe down the wet windshield from inside to acceptable visibility standards. We did not get in an accident as we quickly abandoned the Tesla Model Y and obtained a ride from another vehicle that had a working windshield defroster. We understand that this has been a problem in Canada and is the subject of a Canadian recall. We contacted Tesla, sent them the computer code \"VC front-a447 Cabin Climate Control Issues-requires service\" and were advised that they were familiar with this problem and scheduled a repair which included the removal and replacement of the A/C Compressor/Heat Pump and the 'Supermanifold' at a cost of $1,993.55. We were advised that no 'Recall' was associated with this pariticular VIN and nor was there any warranty but this would be a 'customer pay' repair. After exhausting all efforts at writing and calling in an attempt to have a clear defect leading to a safety violation addressed voluntarily by the manufacturer we feel we are left with no alternative but to ask the Goverment to look into this issue for the safety of others who may drive a Tesla with a heat pump in cold weather and very dependant on the proper operation of a windshield defroster (which the heat pump does) for safe visiblity, crucial to proper operations of a motor vehicle, on the public highways.

We temporarily fixed the bolt and drove the ModelY into our garage ( flat surface) 500 feet further uphill. Upon further inspection we found another bolt separated from its nut on the other side as well (4) other bolts totally loose almost entirely stripped from its counter nut.

I believe, with the nerves of the moment, that about 45 to 60 seconds later, I put auto pilot again, not knowing what hapened. And the car, out of nothing, started spininng again. 3 times, and I hit the opposite wall of the highway. By another miracle, nobody hit me (rush hour, I-95 north, 820am)",

The car slid sideways for about 100 feet or so before going straight into the concrete divider along the Highway (front driver side initial impact, then rear driver side 2nd impact). Control could not be regained with the vehicle. Steering did not work (tried to correct the path), it felt as if brakes did not slow the vehicle as the car approached the divider.

I must say I had likely became over-reliant on the autopilot. No warning was provided to me as, prior to the incident. A similar hydroplane problem can also be seen on a YouTube video posted online for the same model car. I experienced the same outcome as the other vehicle except I hit a divider after crossing lanes. I am however very pleased with how well the car handled the impact and how well the airbags went off, although also unfortunate- I do feel like the car may have been partially responsible for the accident itself.I have experienced a few prior occurrences where the car will jerk the wheel when in autopilot to keep or find a lane, even with hands on the wheel and full attention facing forward.",

    "summary": "There are 4 issues to report for our Tesla Model Y: 1) On the highway, our Tesla often presses on the brakes and slows down by itself when it should not be doing so. This occurs when we have adaptive cruise control on. We\u2019ve noticed that at the time of the slowdown, the Tesla misreads the highway speed limit. For example, the Tesla will read the speed limit as 70 mph, then all of sudden without warning, the Tesla will suddenly read the speed limit at 40 mph, which then causes the Tesla to break and slow down by itself, when the speed limit is actually still 70 mph. This can happen several times on a single highway trip. Aside from the shock we receive as a driver as our vehicle slows unexpectedly, this could cause a rear end collision if a car is following us too closely from behind. 2) When we use adaptive cruise control and the steering assist feature, the car does not recognize to slow down on highway off ramp curves. I monitor the speed around curves, though if a driver is not aware of the issue and expects for the Tesla to take the curve slowly, this could cause an issue. In particular, if there is a big curve, I\u2019d be concerned of the Tesla losing control and going off the road, due to speed. 3) The car will often provide a frontal collision warning, even if there is no car or object in front of the car, while it's in motion. This can lead to confusion for the driver or possibly hard breaking, which could cause a rear-end collision, if a car is following too close behind the Tesla. Also, the Tesla driver may swerve unnecessarily to avoid an object that isn\u2019t there, which could cause a collision. 4) The Tesla is advertised as being able to travel over 300 miles on a single charge, however, the conditions for this to happen seem incredibly difficult to meet, as mileage is usually far less than this. This can cause drivers to overestimate how far they can drive, which could lead to cars urgently pulling of the road to prevent stalling where traffic is.",

    "summary": "Due to the NHTSA demanding the removal of the boombox feature while driving I have had SEVERAL issues which were previously avoidable. The vehicle does not make a sound when driving and often times pedestrians cannot hear the vehicle. The horn without custom sounds is aggressive and could incite road rage from pedestrians or other vehicles when previously being able to play music via the outside speakers via boombox alerted pedestrians and in extreme cases a funny sound accompanied with the horn would cause the pedestrian or other vehicles to notice but not incite road rage. I am imploring NHTSA to allow Tesla to bring back the boombox while driving and the custom horn sounds before more people get hurt! This is an NHTSA demand issue and not a Tesla issue. This is a daily issue when driving in parking lots or through neighborhoods!! NHTSA's original demand being that the PWS was not able to be audibly heard while boombox was engaged is garbage, boombox enabled an audible warning to pedestrians in conjunction with the PWS. Now with the lack of boombox while in drive or custom horn sounds there are many instances personally witnessed, told to me, and experienced where road rage has occurred and pedestrians are in the roadway unaware of a vehicle approaching. I propose the solution of returning to allow custom horn sounds and boombox while driving but when in reverse to mute the boombox and allow the PWS to be heard loudly. This will appease all sides and allow pedestrians a warning signal that the vehicle is in reverse while also not inciting road rage from a gentle or funny custom horn and alerting pedestrians and other vehicles a moving vehicle is nearby when in drive. Again, I implore you to make the right decision and allow Tesla to enable custom horns and boombox while driving to save lives!!",

Manual override of electronic door controls are hidden beneath door panels and trims. With no mechanical connection on the outer handle, even if the driver uses the front manual release, they cannot rescue rear passengers. The outside door handles are electronic ONLY. Imagine a fire like Vancouver happening, when a child is in a car seat or has less mobile passengers like seniors. Neither can be expected to climb to the front or out a side window to reach safety. No means to unlock doors or open doors makes this vehicle unsafe to carry passengers in the back, nevermind versions of my vehicle that have 7 seats and a third row, which will most certainly be carrying kids due to the available room. . This design flaw exists in Tesla Model 3\u2019s also. I\u2019m not sure of other vehicles or brands. Older vehicles with mechanical door controls still allow a door to be opened from outside if on fire or suffering an electrical problem.

Had I not had my hands on the wheel and had I not paid attention, the car would have taken the sharply curving exit ramp and I would have run off the road into trees. This is a failure of the auto-steer software. I have also had issues with auto-steer when driving past on-ramps and off-ramps that do not have dashed lines that continue the right-hand edge of the driving lane. In these cases, the auto-steer attempts to abruptly correct into the middle of the suddenly wider \"lane\" as indicated by the edges of the ramps and the left side dashed line. It should maintain its standard distance from the left lane markings instead of trying to center itself in the suddenly wider perceived lane.

    "summary": "Occasionally, while the Adaptive Cruise Control (TACC) is engaged, the vehicle will suddenly brake as if there is an obstacle immediately in front of the car, even though there is not one and the road is completely clear. Sometimes this happens randomly on a divided highway, other times it happens on a two-lane highway when a large truck is approaching in the oncoming lane. Sometimes it is a minor deceleration, other times it is aggressive braking. During one particular road trip, on an empty & divided highway, the vehicle braked unnecessarily over 20 times in a 1 hour span. This is an ongoing issue and continues to occur any time TACC is engaged and there is a clear, unobstructed road ahead of the vehicle. This prevents a safety hazard to any vehicle(s) following behind, as well as the occupants of the offending vehicle, because it could directly result in being rear-ended. When I initially reported this problem to Tesla in December of 2021, they refused to acknowledge it, much less attempt to address it. I submitted a second request for service that same month, 3 weeks later, and their response was the same. However, when I submitted a third request this month (April 2022), the dealer finally confirmed that this is indeed an issue. Yes, the vehicle has been inspected by the manufacturer.

    "summary": "All of these incidents occurred with adaptive cruise control engaged, and sometimes with lane keeping engaged. The vehicle frequently brakes, or slows dramatically, when on the freeway and there is no obstacle in the vicinity. Over the last three days I made the drive from Burbank to Anaheim along I-5. Always in the same area, the car would suddenly slow. In two out of the three incidents, the \"max speed,\" which was set to 80, dropped to 45. Simultaneously, the car thought it was in a 55 mph zone (it was a 65 mph zone). In one of the three instances, the max speed was not changed, but the car still slowed dramatically. On the same commute, the car navigation always has me get off on Artesia Blvd, and then get right back on the freeway. The adaptive cruise has a configurable follow distance that the car seems to generally ignore. It's a number from 2 to 6 or so, and it's not clear what it's supposed to be (seconds or car lengths). It's rarely either, although it should represent seconds. When traffic comes to a complete stop, the car waits until it is too close to brake. When traffic begins moving, the car waits too long to start moving, and then accelerates excessively to catch up. Finally, when using the regular adpative cruise and lane keeping, I would signal lane changes and initiate the change. The car disengages steering but maintains cruise. In many cases, while still indicating the lane change, the car's lane departure warning will sound and it will attempt to correct my steering, which I have to physically override. My Nissan Leaf had adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and lane departure avoidance, and it never gave me these issues. Oh also, the Tesla frequently and erroneously warns of forward collision. It's really terrible, and it's due in no small part to the removal of the forward radar sensor.",

I asked TESLA several times if there is a way to turn off all the \"assistance\" and just have it function as a \"normal\" cruise control without \"traffic aware\" and other automatic braking features--but the answer was no. I am not exaggerating when I say this happened hundreds of time during my 2 trips. I always turned off the speed control when the roads were curving because I knew it would suddenly brake during a mountain pass curve & upset the vehicle--make it difficult to control, and potentially cause an accident at high speed for NO reason. My risk tolerance is fairly high, I have been driving cars with \"Eyesight\" and radar speed control and advanced safety features for over 10 years and have never felt less trusting or less safe than I do in my Tesla Model Y. I think Tesla should disable the \"safety\" feature until they can resolve the issue (perhaps a stop sale order)--I believe it will cause accidents even when someone is fully aware of its sudden, random braking issues. I have many video clips/pics of when the events ocurred as Tesla asked me to record.",

    "summary": "This complaint is specific to the automatic control of the Model Y related to \"PHANTOM BRAKING\". This is an ongoing problem with the \"AUTOPILOT\" and \"FULL SELF DRIVING\" functions on my car, it has always had. Most of the miles on my car are freeway and highway miles. Regardless of which of the automatic functions selected on my car, \"phantom braking\" occurs repeatedly in a startling fashion that doesn't seem to be related to the environment the car is being driven in. The problem is consistent enough that I will not use any of the auto driving functions when I have passengers in the car with me. The problem requires constant intervention by the driver. There are 2 versions of this type of un-commanded breaking: 1. Unexpected braking with no computer warnings or alerts. It can be hard braking or, light to medium breaking, for no apparent or justifiable reason. This type of breaking can happen sporadically or, at times it can happen in a chain fashion that can be so continuous that it becomes necessary to disengage the automatic functions completely. Although, it happens at varying times of day and different kinds of traffic, making it nearly impossible to relate the event to any specific cause, I have noticed it happens almost 100% of the time when a large vehicle is approaching from the opposite direction on a two lane road. That will usually be version 2 type of full emergency braking. 2. Full emergency braking with computer visual warning and loud computer audio alert. This type of braking is EXTREMELY dangerous because, just like with version 1 braking, it happens un-expectantly and for no apparent or justifiable reason. If this type of braking happens in freeway traffic, as I have experienced, it can cause a rear end collision or worse, a chain of collisions. Tesla is aware of this problem and I have reported it multiple times. I have received no response from Tesla related to these problems. I have experienced this problem since the car was new.",

    "summary": "I was driving on a 2 lane highway at about 60 mph in the middle of my lane. The adaptive cruise control was used to manage my speed. Another vehicle was travelling in the opposite direction going toward me, and in the middle of their lane. The other vehicle was an 18 wheel truck. Suddenly, with no warning, the braking system slowed my vehicle. Both myself and my wife felt our seat belts tighten quickly. There was a vehicle behind us, that nearly hit us when the brakes were applied so quickly, for no apparent reason. I had to quickly put my foot on the accelerator pedal to stop the braking, and get back to the correct speed. This has happened several times, usually when driving on a road that gently curves to the right. The sudden braking also occurred when there was no other traffic, just a new section of pavement on the road ahead of us. The loud collision warning sounds came on each time, which startled us. There was no reason for the warning. This caused me to react very quickly, which could have resulted in overcorrection, possibly leading to an accident. After learning about bug reports, I sent in a bug report to Tesla immediately after every incidents I called Tesla to report the problem. They eventually replied that there were no issues with my vehicle, that it was working properly. I set up a service appointment to have the problem diagnosed. I wanted them to diagnose the \"phantom breaking\". Their diagnosis - \"Verified Proper Operation\". They noted that it was a \"Known Characteristic, future firmware solution\". The correction was \"Remote education\" - they tried to inform me how to correctly drive with adaptive cruise control, then told us to stop using cruise control. My wife and I are scared of using cruise control, as we are sure it will happen again, and someone could crash into us from the rear if it happens again. The way Tesla responded made us feel as if they didn't care about our concerns.",

I did try that for a couple of months, and instead of hard braking, it is a little gentler, but then I run the risk of going over the speed limit as constant pressure has to be applied ontop of whatever the cruise control is set to.

When attempting to use either the full Autopilot system (which includes both adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist), or when using just the adaptive cruise control (without lane keeping), the vehicle would brake suddenly and forcefully. This appears to be in response to a threat perceived by the car, but it would happen on totally clear roads, in great weather, without some of the typical false indicators experienced by \"vision\" based systems. It's noteworthy that both of my cars used the vision-only system, as this vehicle was one of the first ones that Tesla produced that did not include a radar-based system. I experienced phantom braking so often with this car that I was completely unable to use cruise control. On a ~1,000 mile road trip through Wyoming and South Dakota (with minimal traffic in clear conditions on well-marked roads), I experienced over 100 phantom braking incidents in 4 days of highway driving. After that trip, I never used cruise control again regularly, but I would occasionally attempt to see if it fixed itself, and every time I would turn it on, I would have a phantom braking incident within minutes.

I should also note that the warning sound seems to go off at appropriate times as I approach stopped cars and it doesn't brake inappropriately when I approach stopped cars. The only problem I've noticed is cars crossing in front of me, mostly from my left to right, when I'm still comfortably distant from that car. Hope this helps.",

    "summary": "I am aware that NHTSA is investigating Tesla over the emergency braking issue when using its advanced features. When I have read articles about this they always reference auto pilot or full self driving. I wanted to make sure you knew that this issue also impacted adaptive cruise control. When I brought my Model Y home in August of last year I quickly learned I could not safely use the adaptive cruise control. I live in rural NE Iowa, and mainly drive on two lane roads. If I was on a downhill slope and meeting a vehicle with any kind of height to it the car would activate emergency braking, even though the other vehicle was completely in its own lane. It appears to me this issue has gotten better as updates have been issued the last six months and I have started to gingerly use cruise control again. It is common in the winter here to have tall piles of snow in parking lots. I also noticed on a sunny day I could drive right up to one of these piles when parking. It was striking that that huge pile of snow was invisible to the vehicle. Any other time I approach a barrier (e.g. pulling in to my garage) it gives all manner of warnings and a visual indication of how far you are from the wall. This issue would be much more dangerous if an analogous situation occurred using Autopilot or FSD. It is my understanding that for the 2021 Y Tesla went to just a camera based system (dropped LIDAR). I don\u2019t know if that is what caused these problems or not. The car is a joy to drive. BUT, Tesla\u2019s habit of releasing updates and features to the masses before they are fully tested is dangerous in my opinion. There are more Tesla\u2019s on the roads these days, at some point the accidents are going to add up. The ability to update systems that control how a car is operated/functions is relatively new. I would offer that the processes around how these updates are managed should be the subject of a separate investigation.",

Phantom braking and sudden slowing are common place and many times unpredictable. Countless times when oncoming traffic in the other lane approaches, sudden braking and aggressive slowing will occur especially if this happens to be a logging truck or larger vehicle. Coming under any overpass or bridge will also produce phantom braking. This will happen countless times in a single trip rendering the adaptive cruise useless. I complained to Tesla and was called by the corporate office in Denver and told that this is a reality and it was my responsibility to \"teach the neuro-net\" that it's phantom braking was an error by accelerating aggressively during those episodes and producing \"bug reports\" to Tesla! I have had this Tesla 3 months now and have stopped using the cruise control and lane assist because of safety concerns. My attempts at \"teaching\" the computer the correct response has utterly failed. I have had 3 episodes that I know of that someone following closely behind me had to take evasive action which precipitated \"road rage\" type behavior on their part for no fault of my own. Tesla has made no effort to correct this defect and have even cancelled my repair appointments stating it was\"not needed\". Every Tesla owner I discussed this issue with has a similar experience.

It has happened a total of probably 20-30 times in the last 2 months (approx. 5,000 miles). Sometimes it manifests as a gentle, almost tentative tap on the brakes, whereas other times it is a fairly jarring with sudden hard braking. It has not caused any accidents or incidents, but I am concerned about it happening when a car may be behind me.

    "summary": "We are familiar with managing the controls which, in my experience, operate similarly to other vehicles with similar safety and driver-assist features. Unfortunately, in regards to the effectiveness and ease of operation of the TACC, our Tesla is by far the worst of the 5 vehicles with which I'm familiar. The experience of managing TACC with oncoming traffic is frustrating, distracting and sometimes unsafe. Autosteer, because it builds on TACC's systems, is similarly deficient although the features it provides would be extremely welcome when TACC is improved. Nearly every oncoming large truck (including many pickup trucks) caused TACC to brake the car TACC assisted braking was inconsistent. Sometimes an immediate, slight reduction in speed (5-10mph) and other times it was an immediate major reduction in speed, on the order of half-speed within 3 - 5 seconds. It was common to have the car brake from 65 - 35 for no other reason than a large, oncoming truck. After 3 or 4 occurrences of heavy braking, I would turn off TACC and manually maintain speed with the accelerator. This in itself is fatiguing and I would eventually resort to a system in which I would disengage TACC when approached by a truck, usually 200 - 300 yds away and then reengage when traffic was clear Heavy braking was severe enough that, if a there had been a closely following/unaware car, it would have rear-ended our vehicle TACC (and Autosteer) seem \"happiest\" when following other vehicles and, even on 2 lane highways, phantom braking was much less frequent A standard cruise control (no Traffic Assist except for Following Distance) is not available but would be welcome Summary: On the Interstate Highway system TAAC works reasonably well but could use improvement. On 2 lane highways TACC is more work and less safe than operating the vehicle manually and, as a system designed to reduce driver workload and improve safety, it fails.",

I often use cruise control on single lane undivided roads that have speed limits between 35-50mph. When using cruise control in this scenarios the car will often automatically apply the brakes for no obvious reason, often applying the brakes hard enough that the car slows down quickly. Many times the forward collision warning sound is played but there is nothing in front of me in my lane or in the opposite lane. Other times this happens when a car is approaching me in the opposite lane. There have been several cases where the car applied the brakes for no obvious reason so hard that had I not intervened (by pressing the accelerator) the car behind me would have been at risk of hitting me. It has gotten to the point where I am becoming somewhat conditioned to override the automatic braking anytime it happens. That is dangerous and can lead to an issue where the car legitimately has a reason to decelerate but I override it thinking it is braking for no reason. I see this behavior in both cruise control (which Tesla calls Traffic Aware Cruise Control) or in Autopilot. I don't currently have the Full Self Driving feature of the car. It occurs most often when I'm on a single lane undivided road using either cruise control or Autopilot. When I'm using cruise control or Autopilot on a traditional divided highway the unexpected braking happens much less frequently.",

Luckily I was able to pull over safely. I called for an ambulance, everything checked out fine. After that I went to an ER, everything checked out fine again. I thought I was having a heart attack or a stroke, but all the tests came back negative. Initially I thought maybe it's because the Tesla drives, that it accelerates so fast that I wasn't used to the speed. Weeks later I started to see various specialists, ENT, allergist, ophthalmologist, optometrist, neurologist, they all checked me out and said nothing was wrong with me. I had two MRIs and and MRA done on my brain and neck, nothing wrong with me. After that I started thinking if there might be something wrong with the Model Y, so I Googled to see if other Tesla owners experienced the same thing. Then I found that some Teslas (Model X and Y) are known to have distortions and in some cases can cause headache or even vertigo for people. I then looked through my Model Y's windshield, then I noticed several areas of distortion. This led me to believe that my near-fainting was caused by the distortions in the windshield. I have other cars and I have driven highways at high speeds and I have never experienced any kind of dizziness or fainting. I took my Model to Tesla service center, they agreed and admit they do see the same distortions I saw, but they claim the distortions are within manufacturing specifications. I requested for the windshield to be replaced, ended up paying over $1k myself. My situation has improved slightly, but I still notice distortions in the new windshield. My belief is Tesla windshields have defects, they can cause people to have headaches and therefore could be a safety concern for everyone on the road.",

Not explicitly. We have mentioned it to a dealer and said it was a common complaint. Also it is a well known (under addressed) issue amongst Tesla owners.

On local roads even if straight and no obstruction the automatic braking without notice occurs when least expecting. Also the lane departure system disables automatically for the remainder of a drive if you veer off a lane even once and didn't take the corrective action the vehicle thinks should have happened. That's not how a safety feature should work... It should remain on regardless. As much as I do enjoy this car, these quality issues definitely make you second guess and keep a closer eye on how you drive to avoid accidents if the system decides to not work as advertised",

My car has the lasted updates installed. It is not a Full Self Driving vehicle. Since I purchased the vehicle it has had a problem during low light or sunny conditions with suddenly braking when using the cruise control. The situation has been reported to Tesla multiple times and \"bug reports\" were recorded and reported to the service center. During one morning drive of about 35 minutes I reported 8 occurrences. Sometimes the vehicle will sound the emergency avoidance braking. The car will suddenly slow from 60 to 30 mph. On multiple occasions the vehicle behind me had to take evasive action to avoid rear ending me. During one of my service visits the vehicle was taken on an extended over night test drive and the technician confirmed the problem. During the other visit the service center did not even take the vehicle for a drive. in both cases Tesla said the hardware was functioning normally and this was a \"normal\" operating condition for the vehicle. The car does better if I am following another vehicle because it seems to be able to maintain it's depth perception better if it has that reference point. I did report to the service center that the car seems to follow closer at night, even at the max following distance setting. The vehicle also struggles with the automatic high beam headlights which the computer turns on automatically if cruise control is activated. Very often the car is slow to turn the high beams off but in other cases it will turn the high beams off and then turn them back on as another car approaches. I am flashed by other drivers on a daily basis because of this. Tesla does not seem concerned with resolving these known issues.

I have submitted a service ticket with Tesla about this but this seems to be a systemic problem on the TMC forums: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/phantom-braking-in-my-new-model-y.253378/#post-6301315 https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/phantom-braking-and-active-safety-features.248184/ https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/possible-to-deactivate-tacc-and-use-regular-dumb-cruise-control-phantom-braking-unexpected-slowdowns.235813/ https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/27-phantom-brake-in-10-miles-how-often-should-i-press-camera-button-to-report-10-6-1-fsd.250396/",

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 On Monday November 22 at around 6:15 PM CST, I was driving my model Y and had Tesla's Full Self Driving Beta software engaged. A right banked curve on a two lane road in a rural area came up with a vehicle coming around the curve the opposite direction. The Model Y slowed slightly and began making the turn properly and without cause for concern. Suddenly, about 40% of the way through the turn, the Model Y straightened the wheel and crossed over the center line into the direct path of the oncoming vehicle. I reacted as quickly as I could, trying to pull the vehicle back into the lane. I really did not have a lot of time to react, so chose to override FSD by turning the steering wheel since my hands were already on the wheel and I felt this would be the fastest way to avoid a front overlap collision with the oncoming vehicle. When I attempted to pull the vehicle back into my lane, I lost control and skidded off into a ditch and through the woods, causing significant damage to the vehicle. I was able to retrieve the dashcam footage of this incident and it is attached here. I did analyze the footage myself briefly. You can see the vehicle leave the lane, and within about 10 frames, I had already begun pulling back into the lane before losing control and skidding off the road. Since this video is recorded at about 36 FPS, this would mean I reacted within 360ms of the lane departure. I understand it is my responsibility to pay attention and maintain control of the vehicle, which I agreed to when I enrolled in FSD beta. I was paying attention, but human reaction does not get much faster than this and I am not sure how I could have otherwise avoided this incident. I am thankful this was the outcome rather than a front overlap collision with the oncoming vehicle, which would have likely resulted in bodily injury.

Sometimes the braking is when there is a car in the opposing lane and is approaching but not over the line. Sometimes the sudden hard braking occurs for no apparent reason.

This is a serious problem because if there is a car behind me the sudden hard braking may cause that car to crash into me from behind.

This will include all sorts of driving data being sent to Tesla. I have done this dozens and dozens of times. Each time I get a message on the screen thanking me for sending in the bug report. Never once have I ever heard back from Tesla other than the instantaneous message on the screen saying that the bug report has been submitted. I believe that Tesla has had a recall for a very similar problem with the Model S and Model X with Full Self Driving. This recall was fixed almost immediately with an over-the-air software update. However my problem does not relate to Full Self Driving (which my car does not have). This relates only to cruise control. I have spoken to several other Model 3 and Model Y owners who ALL report the exact same problem. A quick search online will reveal hundreds of other similar reports for Model 3 and Model Y owners who do NOT have Full Self Driving.

It was raining, there was no car around me for at least a few hundred feet. Suddenly the \u201cforward collision warning\u201d started beeping, and I felt the steering wheel is forcing itself very sharply to the left, I tried turning back to the right, but I couldn\u2019t. Fearing that the car will end up in the lane of the opposite traffic, I slammed the breaks. The car ended up doing a 180 hitting the dividing guardrail against oncoming traffic. The car was towed to a shop where it was until oct 18 when it was ready for pickup, damage costed about 15k to repair. There was no injuries, and no other car involved. Second incident: On oct 26 A week after I picked up the car from the repair shop, I was driving on the NJ Turnpike N on the left most lane. It was raining, and the car drove over a small puddle of water. Suddenly I felt the steering wheel turning very forcefully to the right. I tried pulling back to the left, but was unable. it felt as if the steering wheel was locked, causing the car to abruptly make a hairpin curve, bypassing the next lane, and hit a car two lanes over. From the impact the car was thrown back to the left, knocked into the highway divider, the car then spun and flew all the way to the other side of the highway. This time there was another car involved. I was in the car with my wife, both of us besides being all shaken up had no injuries, it is not known to me if there was any injuries to the other driver My car was a total loss.

I take great exception to the practice Tesla is utilizing of declaring previously standard features \"BETA\" and making customers deal with their poor results with no accountability. We don't accept BETA seatbelts or BETA tires. This feature was enabled by default on the car upon purchase and it objectively doesn't work safely.

The service rep inspected the crack and very quickly determined that the crack was a result of something hitting the ceiling such as a small rock. The rep's eagerness with her response suggested that she was familiar with this issue and was ready to deny warranty coverage. She told us we should make a claim against our auto insurance policy. We countered that we didn't believe anything had hit the ceiling, and even if it had, the glass should not have cracked that easily. Also, we also pointed out that in all the other cars we've owned we have never experienced rocks being spun up from the road hitting the ceiling. The rep still declined. We went ahead with the repair. We searched the internet for other Tesla owners whose ceiling glass had also cracked and found a number of postings on several forums of customers who had the same disappointing experience we had. It is evident that there is some kind of design flaw that results in the ceiling glass cracking easily. We inquired with a class action law firm who informed us that there is a provision in Tesla's standard warranty in which the consumer agrees not to enter into any class action lawsuits against Tesla and requires arbitration to settle disputes.We wanted to bring this issue to your attention attention because we believe Tesla is well aware of a design flaw that results in the cracking of their glass ceilings and is concealing their knowledge of the frequency of this problem.",

I sent multiple videos of this happening to Tesla's service department. Tesla virtual service has looked at vehicle's logs and says there's nothing wrong with the vehicle and that it must be in how the vehicle is interpreting fleet data and map data. Clearly a software bug not validating it's input for reasonableness.

Like Summon, Smart Summon is only intended for use in private parking lots and driveways. You are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all times and be within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles. Be especially careful around quick moving people, bicycles and cars. To use Smart Summon, open your Tesla app, tap Summon and then select the Smart Summon icon. To activate the feature, press and hold the COME TO ME button. Alternatively, tap the target icon, set the target destination of your choice by adjusting the map, and then press and hold the GO TO TARGET button. You can stop your car from driving at any time by releasing the button. Smart Summon works with your Tesla app and your phone\u2019s GPS to operate. You must be within approximately 200 feet of your car to use. Smart Summon requires the latest version of the Tesla mobile app (3.10.0 or later).

    "summary": "Wiper failure when set to automatic (rain-sensing) when vision system shut down due to poor visibility. A little background: I've been driving for 50+ years, about 1.5M total miles, most of it commuting. I'm a software engineer with 45+ years of experience, mostly in embedded systems. Problem drive: most settings, including headlights and wipers, on auto. Autopilot was on. Drove into a heavy rainstorm, auto wipers worked well, speeding up until they were on high. Traffic speed dropped from 70+ to less than 35 due to rain. Drove into a band of torrential rain. Saw a pop-up on the screen that said something like autopilot turning off due to diminished visibility. Autopilot (speed control) then turned off. THEN THE WIPERS SHUT OFF. Let's see, guy designing vision system: can't figure out anything from camera images, so let's warn user and shut off stuff that relies on the camera. Like autopilot. Wipers? Leave them in the last state? Nah, turn off the enable signal to the auto wiper state, too. Torrential downpour, almost no visibility, and my wipers just shut off. I frantically kept pressing the wiper button on the turn signal stalk to force a couple of swipes and force the wiper pop-up menu, then take my eyes off the road with possibly someone stopping right in front of me (yes, I slowed down) to do hand-eye coordination on the wiper pop-up to hit the manual setting full speed button! Related to Tesla Model S/X recall for touchscreen failure disabling defog/defrost. Proper design requires hard controls (not just touchscreen) for safety-critical items, like lights, wipers, defog/defrost. That's why a hard control for hazard flashers is required. I've spent years designing life-critical medical systems. They all have hazard mitigation matrix sections - analyze possible fault modes, assign chance of happening and severity of impact if they happen, then have a mitigation strategy. This seems to be a system design flaw",

I HAD MY FOOT RESTING ON THE FLOOR AS THE CAR WAS STOPPED AND IN HOLD MODE. SUDDENLY, WITH THE LIGHT STILL RED AND ON ITS OWN, MY CAR ACCELERATED THROUGH THE RED LIGHT INTO THE INTERSECTION AT TOP SPEED. (I WAS THE FIRST CAR IN LINE AT THE RED LIGHT.) I SLAMMED MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE BUT NOTHING HAPPENED, IT KEPT GOING RIGHT THROUGH. A VAN CROSSING THROUGH THE INTERSECTION IN THE OTHER DIRECTION PROCEEDING THROUGH HIS GREEN LIGHT WAS NARROWLY, WITHIN AN INCH, MISSED BY MY CAR, WHICH KEPT GOING ALL THE WAY THROUGH UNTIL IT FINALLY STOPPED AT THE OTHER SIDE. CONDITIONS WERE DRY AND THE WEATHER WAS NICE. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 1:00 IN THE AFTERNOON EST. I CONTINUED TO DRIVE UNTIL I CAME TO A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER, AND THEN CALLED TESLA SERVICE AND ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, AND FOUND THEIR ATTITUDE TO BE VERY DEFENSIVE. I WAS TERRIFIED TO DRIVE IT SO I HAD THEM COME AND TOW IT TO THE SERVICE CENTER WHERE THEY SAY THEY WILL LOOK AT THE LOG. ABOUT A DAY OR TWO AGO, A SOFTWARE UPDATE WAS PUSHED TO MY CAR; THAT WAS THE SECOND SW UPDATE SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR ONE MONTH AGO. THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST TERRIFYING THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED IN MY 42 YEARS OF DRIVING. I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OR MY CAR COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE. THANK GOD NO PEDESTRIANS WERE CROSSING IN FRONT OF ME AT THE TIME, AND THAT I SOMEHOW MISSED THAT PASSING VAN.

THE CAR HAS VARIOUS SETTING FOR BREAKING, BUT EVEN THE SETTING THAT OFFERS THE LEAST BREAKING (CALLED \"ROLL\"), RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT BRAKING ACTION WHEN THE GAS PEDDLE IS RELEASED AT SPEEDS ABOVE 15MPH' ENOUGH FORCE THAT DRIVER AND PASSENGERS FALL FORWARD AGAINST SEAT BELTS. MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY 2-WEEK OLD CAR IS THAT THE CAR WENT OUT OF CONTROL, AND I SLID ACROSS THE ROAD INTO AN EMBANKMENT. I HAVE 30 YEARS OF INTENSE, REMOTE WINTER DRIVING EXPERIENCE, AND I HAVE HAD ZERO ACCIDENTS, UNTIL NOW IN A BRAND NEW TESLA. THE CAR SHOULD OFFER A SETTING WHERE NO MECHANICAL OR REGENERATIVE BREAKING IS APPLIED WHEN THE GAS PEDAL IS RELEASED. ALTERNATELY, THE ANTI-LOCK SYSTEM SHOULD BE ACTIVATED WHEN THE GAS PEDAL IS RELEASED SO THAT THE BREAKING SYSTEM CAN DISENGAGE IF WHEELS STOP ROTATING (IF A SLIDE/SKID IS DETECTED). IT'S A HUGE FLAW THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS OTHERWISE IMPRESSIVE CAR. HERE'S THE GIST: ALL GOOD DRIVERS KNOW THAT IF YOU PRESS A CAR'S BRAKE WHILE ON SNOW OR ICE, (PARTICULARLY IN A TURN OR WHEN THERE ARE OTHER INERTIAL FORCES) THE CAR WILL GO OUT OF CONTROL.

On April 2025 one of the tires broke and I replaced it at the same place with the same tire model. Less than a month after the new tire was installed, while riding on the highway at close to 65mph the recently replaced tire completely broke off leaving only the sides and the rest of the tire flew off the car (see pictures attached). This happened suddenly with no previous indication or car notification of any issue with the tire. Fortunately, I was able to stop the car without losing control and apparently the tire did not hit other oncoming cars. This was a very scary situation, which could have resulted on a serous and even fatal accident. When I checked the new tire, or what remained of it, I noticed it had the same manufacturing date (4422) as the tires I had replaced in 2023. The next day I went to the tire shop and explained the incident and they informed I had to buy a new tire while they investigated the situation and if there was any issue with the tire. At that time I also opened a complaint with Hankook US.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 While reversing in this 2021 Tesla Model Y (software v12, 2025.14.1, Full Self-Driving Supervised), the vehicle\u2019s ultrasonic sensors showed a wall directly behind on the display. However, the Tesla Vision camera system did not visually render the wall, and neither Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) nor Obstacle-Aware Acceleration activated. The car reversed under driver input directly into the wall, causing a collision with property damage. The safety defect appears to be that the ultrasonic sensors, although still present and visually displayed, are no longer integrated into the collision avoidance systems after Tesla\u2019s software updates activating Tesla Vision. As a result, the AEB and OAA systems seem to rely only on camera data, ignoring ultrasonic sensor input \u2014 leaving a dangerous blind spot in reverse. This problem affects safety because the driver receives no warning that AEB or OAA will not engage based on ultrasonic detection alone. Tesla\u2019s updated owner manuals (2023.12) state that AEB is now designed to work in reverse, but in this case, the system failed. The issue has not yet been inspected by Tesla or a dealer but appears reproducible on vehicles with ultrasonic sensors running Tesla Vision software. This is likely a widespread defect affecting 2020\u20132022 Tesla Model 3, Y, S, and X vehicles equipped with ultrasonic sensors but updated via software. There were no warning lights or system alerts before the failure. I request NHTSA investigate whether Tesla\u2019s software has disabled or failed to integrate ultrasonic sensor data into rear collision avoidance, creating an undisclosed safety risk for owners.",

Despite my efforts to address this matter directly with Tesla, their response has been dismissive, prioritizing an out-of-pocket repair fee over a fundamental safety concern. Recently, my [XXX] son discovered that rear driver side seat belt does not latch onto the buckle. When I contacted Tesla to seek assistance in resolving this issue, I was informed I would need to pay out of pocket to replace the buckle because my warranty had expired as of January this year. During the replacement, the Tesla technician pointed out that the other 2 seat belt buckles in the back seat were also defective and would soon not function properly. The Tesla service center in Alhambra, CA was notified but they categorized it as a customer-pay repair. An expired warranty should not absolve Tesla of responsibility for a defect in a critical safety component. Seat belts are essential for driver and passenger protection, and any failure in their function could lead to serious injury or fatality. I am deeply concerned that Tesla does not seem to be taking this issue seriously. Instead of addressing the safety risk posed by the defective seat belts, their response has been to demand payment for a repair that should not be the driver's financial burden. Safety should always be the top priority, and I believe Tesla\u2019s handling of this matter is unacceptable. I urge your office to investigate this issue further to ensure that Tesla is held accountable for addressing potential defects in their seat belts. If Tesla is unwilling to resolve this matter appropriately, I believe regulatory intervention is necessary to protect consumers from similar safety risks.

    "summary": "This report addresses concerns regarding recent safety updates in the Tesla Model Y, specifically focusing on the \"Rear Cross Traffic Alert\" and the blind spot warning system. These updates are intended to enhance driver awareness and prevent collisions. However, there are significant shortcomings in their current implementation that may compromise driver safety. 1. Rear Cross Traffic Alert: Intended Functionality: The \"Rear Cross Traffic Alert\" is designed to warn drivers of approaching vehicles from the side when reversing, thereby preventing potential collisions. Current Implementation: The system currently highlights a portion of the infotainment screen in red when a potential hazard is detected. There is no accompanying audible alert to notify the driver of the danger. Safety Concerns: Drivers are likely to be looking over their shoulder or at their mirrors while reversing, rather than at the infotainment screen. The lack of an audible alert means that drivers may not notice the visual warning, especially if their attention is directed away from the screen. This could lead to an increased risk of collision, as the visual cue alone may not be sufficient to capture the driver's attention. 2. Blind Spot Warning System: Intended Functionality: The blind spot warning system is designed to alert drivers of vehicles in their blind spot when the turn signal is activated, helping to prevent lane-change collisions. Current Implementation: Similar to the Rear Cross Traffic Alert, the system highlights the screen in red when a vehicle is detected in the blind spot. No audible warning is provided to alert the driver. Safety Concerns: In adverse weather conditions, such as rain, drivers may rely more heavily on blind spot warnings due to reduced visibility. Drivers typically turn their heads to check for vehicles, which means they may not see the screen's visual alert. Without an audible warning, drivers may inadvertently change lanes into an occupied space, increas",

    "summary": "This complaint addresses the recent changes made to the cruise control system in Tesla vehicles, as per NHTSA guidance in 2024. While the update aims to simplify the activation of enhanced cruise control, it introduces significant disadvantages and safety risks that need to be addressed. 1. Cruise Control Activation Update: NHTSA Guidance: In 2024, Tesla was required to modify the activation process for enhanced cruise control, allowing it to be engaged with a single pull when the option is selected. There are two options available: single pull and double pull. Advantages: \uf0b7 The update simplifies the process, enabling users to activate enhanced cruise control with a single pull, which is more convenient and user-friendly. Disadvantages: \uf0b7 When the enhanced cruise control is activated and the turn signal is engaged, the system automatically deactivates. \uf0b7 This deactivation causes the vehicle to stop maintaining its set speed, leading to a slowdown or complete stop. 2. Safety Risks: Driver Reaction: \uf0b7 The sudden deactivation of cruise control requires drivers to quickly move their feet back to the gas pedal to maintain speed. \uf0b7 This is particularly concerning when attempting to change lanes or merge into tight spaces, where maintaining speed is crucial for safety. Loss of Safety Features: \uf0b7 Upon deactivation of the enhanced cruise control, the vehicle no longer maintains a safe following distance, transferring full control back to the driver. \uf0b7 This abrupt transition means that the driver is left without the system's assistance to ensure safe driving and timely reactions, potentially increasing the risk of collisions. Increased Driver Workload: \uf0b7 Drivers must frequently reactivate cruise control after changing lanes, which demands additional effort and diverts attention from the road. \uf0b7 This constant need to manage the cruise control system can lead to driver distraction and increased cognitive load, potentially compromising road safety. 3.

    "summary": "On [XXX], our 2021 Tesla Model Y had a catastrophic suspension failure while driving in live traffic. The car came to a sudden stop, the front suspension was loose and the vehicle was not drivable. We had the vehicle towed to the nearest Testa service center in Burlingame, CA. Tesla service center inspected the car and found that the lower lateral links in the front suspension had failed due to two critical suspension bolts falling out. One bolt had completely fallen out and the other had became dangerously loose and was about to fall out. The bolt failures led to a catastrophic failure of the front suspension and the vehicle became undrivable in live traffic. This is a low mileage vehicle with ~29,500 miles and there was no operator error or use that would cause a catastrophic bolt failure in the lower lateral links. Images of the issue from Tesla service center show that the bolts simply fell out after not being sufficiently fastened from the manufacturer. After Tesla service center identified the problem, we researched this issue and found an extremely relevant NHTSA recall for 2020-2021 Model Y vehicles that matches the exact suspension issue that occurred to us (21V-835 / SB-21-31-003 Recall). Our Model Y was built in November 2020, which is within the affected date range of this Recall, and our issue exactly matches this Recall. Tesla service center employees agreed this Recall seemed relevant and investigated. After a couple of days, Tesla service center contacted us and claimed that while the our catastrophic suspension issue looked very similar to the Recall issue mentioned above, our specific VIN was not listed in the Recall. Therefore, Tesla service center refused to repair the failure under warranty or recall and we were stuck with massive repair bill to fix a clear manufacturer defect that is already known and has been recalled. We are not sure why our VIN was not captured in Recall, but have been affected by the same dangerous issue.

Suddenly they heard a loud noise, and the car rattled and went a loud noise. The next thing the driver felt like the car wasn't able to move and he stopped. One side of the car was dropped to the ground. When he got out, he saw the front of the car's bottom was scrapping on the ground. He realized it was a critical error. The suspension on the right side fell to the ground, and two brand new bolts fell on the ground a little behind the car. Right front tire was twisted and pointed to the opposite direction of the other wheel. Neither of the wheels were parallel. The front tire was scratched with some deep marks because it's been scrapping and dragging on the ground. The twisted tire damaged the side of the front right fender because it was out of place. The scariest thing was that the accident happened out of nowhere and it fell apart while the vehicle is moving. Very dangerous. Our Tesla has 53,000 miles on it. And got new tires and rotations about 2 years ago. It was done by Tesla Service. We never had anyone else touch the car but the dealership. We never had any collision. We had the car towed to the Service Center yesterday (Sunday and they were closed.) I contacted Service Center this morning and asked whether this error is related to the similar recall on Tesla Model 3. Suspension fell apart. The staff membered claimed that it had nothing to do with it. He also claimed that he's very knowledgeable about recalls, \"If there is a specific recall relating this problem, I'll be the first one to know.\" I guess he might be right, but what if our car is the first one which experienced this deadliest problem.

    "summary": "To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to report yet another dangerous incident of phantom braking in my Tesla vehicle. As a Tesla owner who has previously filed multiple complaints about this issue, I am deeply concerned and frustrated by the lack of resolution to this potentially life-threatening problem. Today, I experienced a terrifying phantom braking event that nearly resulted in a catastrophic accident. I was driving on a completely empty road with no traffic in sight - no vehicles behind me, none in front, and none approaching from any direction. Suddenly, without any apparent trigger, my Tesla aggressively applied the brakes, violently decelerating from approximately 25 mph to just 3 mph in a matter of seconds. This abrupt and unnecessary braking action caught me entirely off guard. The force of the deceleration threw me forward, and I narrowly avoided losing control of the vehicle. Had there been any traffic behind me, I have no doubt this incident would have resulted in a severe rear-end collision. The frequency and unpredictability of these phantom braking events make me feel unsafe every time I get behind the wheel. It\u2019s only a matter of time before one of these incidents leads to a serious accident or fatality. Despite multiple reports to both Tesla and NHTSA, this critical safety issue remains unresolved. I implore NHTSA to take immediate and decisive action to address this problem. The safety of Tesla drivers, their passengers, and other road users is at stake. Please investigate this issue thoroughly and compel Tesla to implement a permanent fix for the phantom braking problem. Your swift action on this matter is crucial to prevent potential tragedies on our roads. Sincerely, [XXX] INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

For example, Model Y, while parked in front of a closed garage door with Drive engaged, detects that you have pressed hard on the accelerator pedal. Although Model Y still accelerates and hits the garage door, the reduced torque may result in less damage. Obstacle-Aware Acceleration is designed to operate only when all of these conditions are simultaneously met: Drive or Reverse is engaged. Model Y is stopped or traveling less than 10 mph (16 km/h). Model Y detects an object in its immediate driving path.\" However, my vehicle (and at least some other Model Y Performance models) do not behave in this manner. Rather than reducing motor torque when all of the above conditions have been met, it reduces torque every time the vehicle accelerates from a stop. This has been replicated by my local Tesla Service Center, and they confirmed the vehicle did not detect any objects in it's path.

I was in the far left lane with \"full self driving\" activated. The hot lanes were to our left with all traffic on those lanes driving northbound. The gates to the hot lanes were closed to southbound traffic to prevent someone from driving directly into oncoming traffic. Shortly before we were about to pass those closed gates, the Tesla left indicator light came on and the car began to turn. The map showed the car was trying to turn us directly into the closed gates and oncoming traffic. Fortunately, I was paying close attention to this potential problem because the identical thing had happened previously, during the prior 30 day period when full self-driving was made available for free to all Tesla owners in April 2024. On that weekday evening, I was my driving my son northbound on I-395 after his basketball practice. The hot lanes were running southbound. Once again, as I approached the closed hot lane gates, the left indicator light came on as the car prepared to drive us through the closed gates and into the on-coming hot lane traffic. I am not a Tesla critic. I really like the car, but please address this issue ASAP before somebody gets killed.",
