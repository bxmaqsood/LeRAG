    "summary": "Turn signal switch actuator. When engaging in a right turn with the signal on, the turn signal switch will attempt to auto-reset into position where it will regularly engage the left-turn signal 3-blink indication for a lane change. The issue does not occur with every singly turn, but with enough regularity for it to be a very common occurrence on every drive the vehicle takes. On our most recent drive, of approximately 4 miles, the issue occurred 3 times, which was 75% of the right turns made on that trip. Brought the vehicle in for testing and fixes, and was given a loaner vehicle of the same model. Loaner vehicle shares the same exact problem when making right turns. This is a safety issue that should demand a recall, as it is an important safety system to alert other drivers on the road of your intentions. When finishing a right turn and the left signal engages on its own, it can trigger other people to believe you are making a new turn and may confuse them with your intentions on driving, or can occasionally trigger other people to think we are making a left turn when we are not intending to turn at all and they may pull out into the street, and there is no way to cancel the blinks as they are happening. Upon further research, this is a very widespread issue affecting potentially hundreds of thousands of people. When bringing it in for service, it's frequently regarded as a \"car quirk\" or a characteristic but that is unacceptable as this is a serious safety issue with the car as it is the only communicating factor you have with other drivers on the road.",

    "summary": "During my experience with the 2024 Honda Prologue, I have encountered several significant issues related to the vehicle's starter system. Notably, while reversing, the car intermittently engages the brakes as if it detects an obstacle behind it. Additionally, while driving, the vehicle occasionally applies the brakes unexpectedly, presuming that a collision is imminent. Furthermore, I observed a rapid decline in battery power, accompanied by error messages on the dashboard indicating \"Service Soon\" and \"Service High Voltage System.\u201d After consulting with a service center, I was informed that no issues were detected with the vehicle. However, I am presently receiving persistent error notifications stating \"Service High Voltage System\" and \"Reduced Acceleration Drive with Care.\" In addition, the air conditioning system has ceased to function, and I have been unable to charge the vehicle effectively. Each attempt to charge concludes with the message indicating that charging is complete, yet the battery remains at a static level of 91%. These issues present serious concerns regarding vehicle safety. The unpredictability of the braking system could potentially lead to an accident, while a sudden failure of the battery during travel could leave me stranded, endangering myself and others. These examples represent just a portion of the various complications I have experienced, highlighting a significant safety risk associated with this vehicle.",

Anti-Braking System (ABS): This malfunction posed a significant safety risk.

Transmission (Shifting into Neutral): This issue is extremely dangerous, especially on busy roads. When the vehicle unexpectedly shifted into neutral, I was unable to accelerate, which could have resulted in a dangerous situation if it had occurred on a highway or in heavy traffic, putting my family\u2019s safety at risk. Both problems have been reported and inspected by the dealership but they were unable to reproduce the issues.

The service team advised that repairs would take at least three weeks.

On both instances, the front axles were replaced. However, the noise persists even after these replacements. During my most recent visit on 04/03/2025, I was informed by Honda representatives that they have exhausted all current solutions and that there is nothing further they can do to resolve the noise issue at this time. I am deeply concerned about this ongoing problem. The persistent noise when turning indicates a potential defect that could compromise the safety and reliability of my vehicle. Despite two attempts at repair involving the replacement of the front axles, the issue remains, and Honda has indicated an inability to provide a further remedy. I request that the NHTSA investigate this matter. I believe this may be a more widespread issue affecting other 2024 Honda Prologue vehicles and poses a potential safety risk to drivers.",

Even at low speeds, it is noticeable when breaking, with about a second and a half of five to six rebounds back and forth. It is highly prominent with stronger braking or stop-and-go traffic, resulting in about two seconds of hard rocking back and forth. This problem happens more when the car is being driven in normal mode, meaning using both the acceleration and brake pedals; it\u2019s less pronounced when driving in \u201cone-pedal\u201d mode. I took the car to the dealer service department, and they tested my car and other Prologues. The service department manager said this seems to be a problem in all the Prologues, even a 2025 model they tested. This problem is causing motion sickness for me and my wife, which can lead to distractions and potentially unsafe behaviors as explained below: * Distraction: Passengers experiencing motion sickness may be too focused on their discomfort to pay attention to the road or the driver, which can be dangerous. * Nausea and Vomiting: Nausea and vomiting can cause a passenger to become ill, which can be a distraction and potentially lead to unsafe behaviors like reaching for a trash bag or losing control of their body. * Safety of the Driver: If a passenger struggles with motion sickness, the driver may be distracted by the passenger's discomfort, which can lead to unsafe driving behaviors. * Increased Risk of Accidents:If a passenger becomes ill and the driver is distracted, the risk of accidents increases. Even though the dealership acknowledged that this seems to be a widespread problem based on the tests that their service department did, they are unwilling to take action until an official recall is in place.

    "summary": "I am writing to express my serious concern regarding an ongoing issue with my vehicle, which began pulling to the left at around 3,500 miles. I promptly brought my vehicle to Bay Ridge Honda's service department for inspection, where I was advised to return when the regional service technician was available for a more thorough diagnosis. I returned to the service department at 6,600 miles, and after lifting the vehicle and conducting an inspection, the technician performed a road test. He identified a problem with the front axle, stating that it would need to be replaced. However, the technician also indicated that replacing the axle would not resolve the issue, as the same problem would likely recur within 700 miles. He further explained that the only way to permanently address this issue would be for Honda to issue a recall for the faulty component. Given that this problem concerns a critical safety feature of the vehicle, I am extremely concerned about driving a vehicle that may be unsafe. This is particularly troubling, as I purchased the vehicle brand new and have taken no action to cause this issue. The prospect of continuing to drive a vehicle with a component integral to both the safety and daily operation of the car is unacceptable. I would greatly appreciate your urgent attention to this matter and would like to explore any potential solutions that may be available in the interim. My primary concern is ensuring the safety of both myself and others on the road.",

    "summary": "Leased the 2024 Honda Prologue EX AWD on [XXX] and attempted to get the HondaLink app setup so I could see the charge level and other vehicle features. Also wanted to select my charging option and access EVGO credits. Received the text link but would not activate. I waited a week before stopping by the dealership to see if it would correct itself. Contact Honda Support and they resent the text link and told me it would take up to 24 hours to activate. I waited 48 hours and called Honda support, I proceeded to tell them that in addition to the app not working the integrated Google Maps was not functioning as it indicated the car was in Mexico, when in fact I was in Virginia. The Honda support person elevated my case to 2nd tier support and they indicated it would be 24 to 48 hours before I would get a response. I talked to tier 2 support person the next day and after some basic troubleshooting they transferred me to OnStar support as none of the OnStar buttons functioned either. After troubleshooting with OnStar they told me that 5he telematics module was probably bad and that I needed to take it to dealership, so 11 days and less 400 miles later I took my vehicle to the dealership. That was late on [XXX]. The dealership contacted me on the following Monday to tell me they need the car a little longer so their technician that was most familiar with the Prologue could look at it on Tuesday. The dealership called me back on Tuesday and said the telematics module needed to be replaced, but it was on a nationwide backorder until the middle or end of March. They did tell me the vehicle was drivable, but my concern is that without OnStar if I was in an accident and incapacitated it wouldn\u2019t be able to contact emergency services. I did receive an update that the part is now expected to arrive April 6th, so my vehicle sits at the dealership still and I have now made 3 payments on it even though I have only driven it for 11 days.

Within a week, the vehicle displayed multiple braking system failure warnings, including \u201cBraking system failure,\u201d \u201cService Stabilitrak,\u201d and \u201cBrake assist failure.\u201d One-pedal driving also became unavailable. Upon attempting to drive, the brakes were completely unresponsive, causing the car to roll down a ramp uncontrollably before eventually stopping. Despite multiple attempts, the brakes failed entirely, making the vehicle out of my control. I immediately called Honda\u2019s OnSite service, and the car was towed back to the dealership. The dealership initially diagnosed the issue as a loose connector that was allegedly not properly attached during assembly. They assured me the vehicle was now functioning as designed. However, about a week later, the same critical brake failure occurred again. The car would not brake, forcing me to request another tow back to Honda Carland. This time, the dealership claimed the issue was due to a faulty brake master unit, which they replaced\u2014a far more serious defect than initially diagnosed. Given the life-threatening nature of repeated total brake failure, I refused to drive the vehicle and attempted to return it. In researching this issue, I have found similar complaints in online searches, including the NHTSA database, suggesting that this may be a much broader issue affecting Honda Prologue vehicles manufactured in 2024. This is not a minor issue\u2014it is a safety hazard that puts my life and the lives of others at risk. I am not willing to drive this defective vehicle, and I urge the NHTSA to investigate this matter immediately to ensure that no other driver is put in danger due to brake system defects in the Honda Prologue.

Also, it happens when the temperature is below and above freezing). However, the latter situation occurs randomly and seems to happen more frequently while driving, though it also occurs when I am just starting the car. On top of that, the Forward Collision Warning system is extremely sensitive and has caused the car to brake hard unnecessarily on me with and without Adaptive Cruise Control enabled. Sometimes it even warns me of something that isn't even there.",

    "summary": "I have encountered recurring problems with the vehicle's automatic braking system, as well as issues with the Honda Prologue app, both of which I believe compromise the vehicle's safety and performance. The vehicle's automatic braking system appears to be malfunctioning, as it has activated unexpectedly on multiple occasions, leading to near-miss accidents. At least three occasions, the vehicle\u2019s brakes have engaged without cause, even in situations where there is no obstruction or \u201cphantom\u201d vehicle detected. This automatic braking has not only been inappropriate but also posed a significant safety risk to both myself and other road users. Additionally, the reverse braking system exhibits similar issues, activating without cause. Despite the alerts being on and the brakes not being engaged, the system\u2019s warning signals still activate, leading to further confusion and potential danger. I have consulted with both the dealership and the Honda Prologue forum, and it has been confirmed that this is an ongoing issue. The dealership has indicated that they have no immediate workaround or solution. The only remedy has been to disable these safety features entirely, which negates the very purpose of having them. The Honda Prologue app, which is intended to provide critical vehicle information and allow remote monitoring and control, is also malfunctioning. I have been in communication with Honda for over two months regarding these issues, but unfortunately, no viable solution has been provided. The app is essential for monitoring vehicle functions such as theft prevention, charging status, and temperature control, all of which are key safety and convenience features. In particular, I am concerned about my ability to monitor the vehicle\u2019s charging especially given the increasing number of incidents involving electric vehicles catching fire during or after charging. Proper monitoring of charging status is crucial to avoid potential overcharging and battery degradation.",

    "summary": "As others have reported here and elsewhere online, my Prologue emergency braking/collision detection system repeatedly activates when there is no danger of a collision. Backing out of my driveway I can expect that 25-50% of the time the car will slam on the brakes for no reason and apply the parking brake, which I then have to disengage manually to continue backing out. More recently, I was driving 30 mph on a city street with no one in front of me when without warning the Prologue slammed to a complete stop. Fortunately no one was behind me or I almost certainly would have been rear-ended. After four months of owning the Prologue, and seeing this exact problem reported over and over again, it's evident the entire electronics system is glitchy at best and downright dangerous at worst. Everything from the crash-avoidance cameras (regularly issues messages that they're blocked when they're obviously not) to the remote starter (supposed to come on with two quick presses of a button on the fob, but often takes a dozen or more to actually activate) is borderline non-functional. Whether this is a software or a hardware problem, or some combination thereof, there's no question in my mind that sooner or later, as more of these vehicles are on the road, one of these malfunctions is going to cause a crash. I hope the NHTSA will see enough of a quorum of similar complaints to investigate before that happens. For my part, I've turned off all driver assist systems in my Prologue, which is the only way I can be assured the car will only brake when it should. Additionally, again as many others have reported, my Prologue knocks somewhere in the vicinity of the front axle whenever I corner sharply enough in either direction.",

Based on my observations, I suspect that the noise is coming from the axle, particularly one of the CV joints. The clicking noise is noticeable at low and moderate speeds, and it occurs consistently every time I turn the vehicle. Safety Risk: If the issue is indeed related to a malfunctioning CV joint, this could potentially pose a significant safety risk. If the CV joint were to fracture or break while driving, it could result in a loss of control of the vehicle, leading to an accident. While the noise itself is not an immediate hazard, the possibility of a sudden failure of the axle or CV joint is concerning, as it could impair my ability to control the vehicle and could potentially cause a serious crash. Reproduction/Confirmation by Dealer or Service Center: The problem has not yet been inspected by a dealer or independent service center. However, the clicking noise can be reproduced consistently every time I turn the car, whether turning left or right. Given the regularity of the noise, I believe this issue is likely to continue and should be addressed. Inspection by Manufacturer, Police, Insurance, or Others: At this time, the issue has not been inspected by the manufacturer, police, or insurance representatives. Since the noise has only recently started and has been persistent, I have not yet taken the car to the dealership for an inspection, but I intend to do so soon. Warning Lamps or Messages: There have been no warning lamps, messages, or alerts shown on the dashboard related to this issue. The vehicle continues to function normally aside from the clicking noise when turning. No other symptoms or mechanical issues have been noticed.

It sounds like a loud knocking/creaking noise and I usually hear it three times during a turn. It can be heard over a moderate volume radio. The sound has been replicated by a service technician at the dealership, who thought they corrected it (found a loose bolt under the panel under the passenger seat!) but they did not fix the actual problem and it continues. The sound remains and seems to be getting louder. I am increasingly concerned about what happens if the noise continues to get louder and the part(s) eventually fails - and where the car will go if that happens. This has happened on repeat occasions from 30-55 mph (though usually starting from a stop, like being at a light waiting for my chance to turn left).",

Traffic behind me was then also forced to slam on their brakes and I feel this could have easily lead to a collision if the driver behind had not been attentive. On another case the vehicle engaged brakes while traveling at 60mph on a two lane highway. I was traveling straight, approaching a rightward bend in the road. My steering wheel was still straight ahead because I had not yet reached the turn. Meanwhile a vehicle was coming the opposite direction around the bend. I believe the system engaged because I was steering straight toward the other vehicle - not taking into account the fact that my lane would bend before reaching it. In this case the system did not stop the vehicle but it did cause a rapid change from 60mph to 40mph in a section of road with no obstructions where neither myself nor drivers around me would expect my vehicle to slam on the brakes.

The vehicle's automatic braking system appears to be malfunctioning, as it has activated unexpectedly on multiple occasions, leading to near-miss accidents. On at least three occasions, the vehicle\u2019s brakes have engaged without cause, even in situations where there is no obstruction or \u201cphantom\u201d vehicle detected. This automatic braking has not only been inappropriate but also posed a significant safety risk to both myself and other road users. The reverse braking system exhibits similar issues, activating without cause. Despite the alerts being on and the brakes not being engaged, the system\u2019s warning signals still activate, leading to further confusion and potential danger. I have consulted with both the dealership and the Prologue forum, and it has been confirmed that this is an ongoing issue. However, the dealership has indicated that they have no immediate workaround or solution. The only suggested viableremedy has been to disable these safety features entirely, which negates the very purpose of having them. The Honda Prologue app, which is intended to provide critical vehicle information and allow remote monitoring and control, is also malfunctioning. I have been in communication with Honda for over two months regarding these issues, but unfortunately, no solution has been provided. The app is essential for monitoring vehicle functions such as theft prevention, charging status, and temperature control, all of which are key safety and convenience features. I am concerned about my ability to monitor the vehicle\u2019s charging, especially given the increasing number of incidents involving electric vehicles catching fire during or after charging.

Brake booster ordered 12/17 with no ETA. 2 days go by with no communication from them. I ask what's up. Still no ETA. I mention lawyer on Monday the 22nd & wow my part is there on Tuesday! Tells me car will be fixed by 12/27. That day comes only for them to tell me their system isn't working again to program the car. I file a case with Honda. I hear nothing from the dealership again until 1/8/25. I filed lemon law on 1/7. I hear nothing from service again until 1/13 just more excuses & about engineers coming to look at the car and ordering a new module. Get another message from them today that the car can be picked up(1/17/25). I cannot wait to get rid of this vehicle. I do not feel safe driving it anymore especially with 2 children. Luckily I was not on a highway or far from home when these brake failures occurred.",

Shortly after, the \u201cEmissions System Problem\u201d warning message appeared on the dashboard. A local Honda dealer suspected a malfunction in the fuel injector system, which may have led to improper fuel combustion, reduced acceleration, and overall unstable engine behavior. This issue could increase the risk of an accident, particularly when merging or accelerating in traffic, due to delayed throttle response. Many other CR-V Hybrid owners have reported similar symptoms online, pointing to a potential widespread defect in the fuel delivery system. Despite this, there is currently no official recall for the fuel injectors in this model. I am concerned that this issue, if left unresolved, could lead to engine damage or even pose a fire risk due to unregulated or incomplete fuel combustion.

Needless to say he said no and pretty much ripped me a new asshole for tapping him - I apologized and said \"i thought you rolled into me\".

They stated that no computer error codes were found. A Honda certified repair center was recommended.. The car was towed to this repair center. It cost approximately $18,000 to repair the car and took 10 weeks. I also contacted American Honda to report the issue. I was told that I should call again after the repairs were finished and that additional testing would be done. I did call Honda after the repairs were done but did not hear back from them. I drove the car from the end of January 2024 until November 2024. At that time a second episode of unintended acceleration occurred on 11-14-2024, also while I was pulling into my garage. This caused damage to the right front end of the car and to the garage wall. I feel that this car is not safe to drive. I am concerned about a recurrence of unintended acceleration putting myself and others at risk. I have elected not to have the damage from the second accident repaired since I will not be driving this car again. I contacted American Honda again after the second incident. I provided them with documentation of the damage to the car along with insurance claims and repair bills. The case is now in the mediation department at American Honda.

It took almost 2 months for Honda to fix one of the recalls, but they said the parts were not in for the fuel pump. They told me to keep checking back with them. It is now approaching the end of February, and when I called Honda back again to check on getting my fuel pump recall fixed I was informed that there was NO remedy available to fix the problem. I drive my children to and from school every day and to their extra curricular activities. Online it states that the improper production of a high pressure fuel pump can create safety concerns. I am extremely uncomfortable knowing the new vehicle I am driving can lead to an increase chance of injury or fire. I want a replacement car if this recall can not be fixed in a timely manner.",

    "summary": "Failed component: The windshield washer system is faulty \u2013 particularly the passenger side. Honda refers to it as a \u201cwet arm wiper\u201d system. More specifically, the washer fluid is emitted from the wiper arm instead of a more direct spraying method. As such, it does not spray out evenly across the windshield. It basically dribbles onto the windshield, with a delay, and winds up getting dumped onto the bottom of the windshield and the outer edge of the wiper blade. The small amount of washer fluid that does get onto the windshield simply gets mixed with the debris on the windshield and dirties and obscures the windshield even more and makes it even harder to see out of. This is particularly dangerous when the vehicle in operation when the windshield washer is used and the windshield become smeared and obscured in traffic. The vehicle is available for inspection upon request Safety risk: Upon utilizing the windshield washer system while driving in traffic, the windshield becomes smeared and obscured to a point where the operator cannot see very well out of the windshield. Reproduction by dealer: The issue was reported to the dealer on 1/28/2025 and dismissed as \u201cnormal wet arm operation\u201d. Inspections: As stated above, the issue was reported to the dealer on 1/28/2025 and dismissed as \u201cnormal wet arm operation\u201d. Warning / messages / symptoms / first appeared: There were no warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure.

This put me at immediate risk of an accident as other vehicles were traveling at normal highway speeds. This issue arose less than 136 miles after my vehicle underwent recall repairs on [XXX] at Superstition Springs Honda in Mesa, Arizona. The recall repairs included: \u2022Fuel Pump Safety Recall (NHTSA Recall 24-049) \u2022CVT Greasing Recall (NHTSA Recall 24-123) After the recall repair, my vehicle displayed a dashboard warning on [XXX] stating: \u201cEmission System Problem. Power may be reduced. See your dealer.\u201d Following this warning, the vehicle failed to accelerate properly despite pressing the gas pedal, making highway driving unsafe. I took my vehicle back to the dealership immediately. The dealership categorized this as an emissions system failure but has not confirmed if it is related to the recall repairs. The dealership also stated that I would need to drive 500 miles after any repair to \u201cconfirm\u201d the issue is resolved, which is unreasonable and unsafe given the circumstances. This is a serious safety defect. A sudden loss of acceleration on the highway creates a high risk of collisions, injuries, or fatalities. Other 2024 Honda CR-V Hybrid owners have reported similar emission system failures after recall repairs, suggesting this may be a widespread issue. This issue is now under review by Honda Corporate (Case #[XXX]), but I have not received a clear resolution or assurance that my vehicle will be permanently fixed. I request that NHTSA investigate whether Honda\u2019s recall repairs are causing secondary defects leading to acceleration failures.

    "summary": "There are a few safety issues I've experienced multiple times while driving this car. To the best of my knowledge, there haven't been any warning lamps or indicators on the dash related to these issues. When driving, the car will activate the emergency braking system, braking incredibly hard at freeways speeds and street driving speeds even though there is nothing near or close to the front of the car. The car has braked so intensely that items fly around the car and that both my son and I have experienced back, neck, and shoulder pain from the unexpected/severe braking. The other safety issue I've experienced is the lane departure/keeping sensors going off on the dash and the car pulls itself out of the lane. It seems like the car thinks I've departed the lane and is trying to pull me back into the lane, but, in reality, I am in the lane and the car is pulling itself into the next lane (sometimes even when another car is next to me or approaching). This is a safety concern since it causes swerving and my car could crash into another car or a lane divider if I didn't react so quickly to overpower the automatic lane departure. It's also a recurring issue to have to fight the car to keep it in the lane and makes for very tense driving. The last issue is an electrical one, I believe, related to the infotainment panel. The power on the infotainment system goes off unexpectedly while driving. It sometimes will not power on during start up. If it turns off while driving, sometimes I have to stop, turn off the car, and restart it to get it working again and other times it reboots itself after a minute or a few. All of these issues have happened countless times, as long as I've had the car. I've had it inspected and during the most recent inspection (Sept 2024) they asked me to come in to drive the car so that the issues would be reproduced while the mechanic was sitting in the passenger seat. I was able to reproduce the issues while the mechanic was in the car with me.",

At random times car decelerates quickly as if pressing on brakes, or losing engine power (fuel supply, ignition, etc.), or downshifting quickly. After a few seconds car can be accelerated and resumes speed. In virtually every case it has occurred on dry, clear roads with no vehicles or obstructions ahead. Car, cameras and sensors were clean. Occurs when accelerating either slowly or rapidly. Occurs when entering a highway from an ON ramp. Occurs at 10 mph or 70 mph. Driver is not touching the paddle downshifter. Sometimes deceleration occurs multiple times within seconds after the previous - 2 to 3 times. Rapid slowing does not occur when in cruise control, or when manually increasing speed in cruise control. In all cases Red Brake warning light in instrument panel does not flash and there is nothing immediately in front of car. This condition is extremely dangerous, especially when there are vehicles behind, and they are not expecting my vehicle to slow rapidly. Occurs when accelerating to pass a car ahead. Or when trying to accelerate onto a highway to match speed of approaching traffic. We are always in fear of being hit from behind by unsuspecting drivers.

The error messaging included \u201ctransmission failure, loss of power, emissions control\u2026\u201d. I had not seen alerts prior to this incident, and was not aware of changes in performance other than a recent, minor, decrease in fuel efficiency. Fortunately, I was able to safely exit the freeway & park in a nearby shopping center. My vehicle was towed to the local dealer, Marin Honda. After a week of evaluation, and consulting with Honda America tech support, the dealer reports difficulty isolating the problem and determining appropriate repair. At this time a cracked piston has been identified, and the plan is for a technician to use a barescope to evaluate the cylinder for damage, and the potential need to replace the engine. I am concerned that multiple owners of this model & year have reported the same problem, including loss of power while traveling at high speed (see CRV Owners Club) Their vehicles were also determined to have cracked pistons, with and without cylinder damage. It has also been noted that when the fuel injector remains open it may be a contributing factor to a cracked piston. Could this be relevant to the current recall issued for the fuel pump on the 2024 CRV? Whatever the cause, the potential for catastrophic engine failure places drivers and their passengers, as well as other drivers, at great risk of a serious accident.",

It was a stop/go, stop/go event as 6 lanes were going down to 1 lane. I was behind a Kroger semi-truck. I had my foot on the brake. I thought the people next to me had started to move, but then I noticed that I was getting closer to the truck (while my foot was on the brake). I pushed the brakes down further. I felt normal resistance. Nothing happened. I hit the cancel button of the adaptive cruise multiple times on my steering wheel thinking that perhaps my adaptive cruise started my movement. I kept rolling. Kept hitting the brakes wondering why I didn't stop. No beeps went off like they normally do. I rolled into the truck. My adaptive cruise had been set to 70, and I had used it before the incident. It was still on standby, but not green. My odometer was around 9547. This happened around 9:50am. No beeping sounds started or emergency braking happened. I would approximate my speed of hitting around 3-5 mph. I hit the truck. I had tried to switch to neutral and then to park. I could not move the gear shaft. I was hitting the brake hold. Anything to make me stop. Nothing worked, and I hit the truck. I did not move after hitting the truck, maybe one of the things I attempted to do worked. My foot was still on the brake. I pulled over, turned off the car, and restarted it. I have not applied the adaptive cruise since then. I don't know if it had anything to do with the incident, but I'm afraid to use it. If I had been moving at a faster rate, my safety and others would have been at risk. I took the car to the dealership. They provided me with a Honda multi-point vehicle inspection checklist and stated that they couldn't find anything wrong. There is definitely something wrong.

There was a tractor trailer behind us who put his flashers on, realizing the issue stayed behind us to keep cars from hitting us. All warning lights came on, first engine then all of the safety warnings. Car would not run. It was towed to a Honda dealer in Fayetteville. Honda analyzed the issue as a misfire resulting in engine damage. They performed a boroscope and found 3 piston cracked. Honda after 3 weeks installed a new short block and fuel injectors. Car was one year old with 6280 miles. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

It appears that the sensors/radar had been disconnected or disabled although the dash settings show that they are on.

I'm concerned about the possibility of the computer being the problem. We have less than 12,000 miles on the CRV Hybrid.

It was 36 degrees outside that morning and there was frost on the car. I drove my car approximately 2 miles and it was cracked. There is no other damage to the car or mirror. I contacted my local Honda dealer to have them fix the issue but they told me this was not a warranty issue and I needed to make a claim on my insurance, which I refuse to do because it was not involved in an accident or incident. I've also filed a complaint with Honda Corp directly. This issue of the side mirror cracking in cold weather appears to be an issue with a lot of 2024 CRV's according to internet searches.

    "summary": "Honda has all these controls on their steering wheel that can accidentally be turned on, even while driving, and have any of those adaptive functions suddenly start working. For example, twice already I was driving and somehow the \"Lane Keeping Assistance\" turned on. My steering wheel was shaking and I couldnt control it, get it to stop. It frightened me & the first time I pulled over on the side of the road thinking my cars tie-rods have broken. It did it again last night and I was really frightened. My husband reached over & turned it off. He said I must have turned it on while holding the steering wheel. I had another function \"Lane Depature warning\" turn on when I was trying to switch lanes. I was fighting with the steering wheel. The paddles on the wheel are also a hazard. I reached for the turn signal & hit a paddle. I dont know what the hell these do & I was freaking out thinking what did I just turn on now that we make me lose control of the car. These functions should not be something that can be turned on once the car is started. I have never had any issues with cruise control on any car I own. I really do not like this car. I'm scared. I will need to drive my husbands mercedes because I fear the Honda CRV. I cant return the car. How many people have been in accidents or killed because they functions can turn themselves on without the driver knowing they did. This is not a nuisance, this is a accident waiting to happen. Please, something needs to be done. I spent $40K on a disaster. Thank you",

The sticking typically happens when the steering wheel is slightly turned to the left; the steering column and wheel automatically skip back to the right.

Initially this happened only on the interstate on trips of longer duration (I purchased the car new in July 2023 and first noticed it on my first road trip in November 2023), but beginning in January 2024, it has started happening regularly while I am driving around town on surface streets. At this time, I do not feel as if it causes a significant safety risk, however given that the issue has significantly increased in frequency in a few short months (November- January), I do have concern that it could cause major safety concerns if not addressed. I have not taken the car to the dealership yet. I have seen that many other owners of 2024 CRVs have filed similar reports with NHTSA and there are numerous accounts on ownership groups online, so I wanted to file my own.

    "summary": "Our complaint is in regards to the factory horn Honda is installing on the current generation of CR-Vs. After purchase one week ago of our 2024 model year, we noticed the horn was very faint. Believing it to be a defect, we researched online and found that it is as designed. The horn is so poor that dealers are selling \"upgrade kits\" and posting online videos on how to install. The standard horn comes as a single high-tone that is insufficient. These kits include a second low-tone horn and a y-splitter cable that will hook into the factory single high-tone horn. Once the low tone is installed, the horn sounds and functions as any vehicle should be expected to function. But otherwise, the factory single high-tone is inadequate and not safe. I have tested this by having my spouse behind me on the roadway in clear weather at night and stopped at a red light. The horn is very faint and not adequate enough to provide proper warning if needed. If I was not expecting the horn test from my spouse, I would not have thought it was a vehicle horn at all. Now consider adding in poor weather and driving at 70mph, the horn would do nothing to warn another driver from an improper lane change to avoid a collision. With over 10 years of law enforcement and traffic-related experience, I am asking that this matter be investigated and require Honda to issue a recall to bring their horns up to standard by providing the fix to owners at no charge to add the low-tone second horn so that the vehicle will sound a warning at a volume and depth as needed in everyday usage. Buyers should not have to pay to upgrade this most basic of safety equipment and does not provide good optics for Honda to cut costs in this way and increase margin for dealers as an aftermarket kit.",

    "summary": "When driving in a straight line, the car pulls to the left, requiring me to correct the drift by steering the car to the right. There is a lot of effort put into correcting the gradual and progressive drifting of the car, especially during highway driving. Correcting the steering is a constant during the drive. The steering itself also feels \"stiff.\" Much effort is needed to correct the steering, making it very difficult to traverse the roads, especially when quick and accurate response is needed to avoid debris on the road, potholes, other cars, and even simple tasks like lane change. This started happening even before the vehicle hit 1,000 miles on the odometer. Additionally, there were two occasions in which the power steering light came on the dash when remote starting the vehicle, but would turn off when cycling the car. The light came on once prior to the sticky steering issue and once more after having experienced the start of the sticky and stiff steering. I have not remote started the car since. The dealer has noted this, but could not find a reason why this is happening as a diagnostic check did not reveal any errors. Adding to the steering issue, there is a lot of effort needed to make right turns and left turns, even at low speeds. All of these issues could not be replicated by the dealer. However, the dealer did not take the vehicle on a prolonged drive nor on the highway at highway speed. The dealer has noted that if the problem persists, to take it back. It is still persisting. The car has 2,000 miles on it currently, and I have only had possession of this vehicle for one month.",

The worst part of this issue is that it causes turning to be unsmooth because the wheel doesn't turn smoothly. At any speed, I can notice the weighting of the steering wheel when I hit the (replicatible) sticking point- and then it is as if the vehicle \"skips a few steering teeth\" because it cause the wheel to turn a little more quickly as if to catch up to where I had intended to point the tires.

My vehicle also has times when I am travelling on straight city streets with no traffic in front of me, where the automatic emergency braking come on quite firmly for a second or two, without any apparent reason. Again, this presents a possible safety hazard to the vehicles behind me who may be following a little closer than they should, and may possible drive in to the back of my vehicle. Again, I am not aware of any brake lights present on my vehicle when this happens. A big improvement would be in the manner in which the radar sees things and makes false applications of this braking system, as well as having teh vehicle brake lights activate when this system decides to engage.",

I included lane driving assistance in the \"problem parts\" section here not knowing if there is a connection. Not only is there resistance, but frequently the steering will suddenly jerk to either side. This is very slight and has not caused a major straight line deviation, but I know this should not occur and for all I know can get worse. I have repeated these circumstances while using and not using any lane assistance. No warning lamps or messages have appeared. I am taking the vehicle to my dealer during the week of 12/11, so no inspections as of yet.

A local Honda dealer suspected a malfunction in the fuel injector system, which may have led to improper fuel combustion, reduced acceleration, and overall unstable engine behavior. This issue could increase the risk of an accident, particularly when merging or accelerating in traffic, due to delayed throttle response. Many other CR-V Hybrid owners have reported similar symptoms online, pointing to a potential widespread defect in the fuel delivery system.

We're going to take it again Monday the 21 to diag job in Spreen Honda of Loma Linda. Please help!",

We were driving in the leftmost lane when suddenly we heard a loud thud noise and the tire immediately went 90 degrees causing us to lose steering control. The vehicle went from the left lane into the shoulder, making contact with the side barrier on the highway with the tire as first point of contact. We immediately attempted to regain control of the vehicle and managed to steer it out of the barrier and slowly come to a skidding stop in the shoulder area. Multiple suspension components damaged, possibly transmission, wheel damaged, ball joint and axle damaged, left front strut, strut mount, strut bearing, and upper spring seat damaged. We got it fixed for the first time for 6.1k then they wires another fix for the back wheel because the entire wheel and more parts were damaged and they want to fix it for 1k more. and then today I got another quote for 1.3k for the strut. They have done multiple diagnostic tests and alignment tests but keep coming with more issues. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

    "summary": "I have a 2024 CRV hybrid Sport L. I recently had a warranty claim, that was attributed to an issue with the throttle body. The engine reduced power and would not go over 25mph. And emissions fault was announced, which forced the turning off of all safety features of the car. I was able to drive to the dealership during non-traffic hours. I don\u2019t know if this could mid-drive , but mine fortunately happened when I turned the car on. I got the dealership to replace the throttle body and take pictures of the problem before and after. It appears that the EGR dumps downstream of the throttle body causing the butterfly valve \u201cpin\u201d to corrode and that tripped an emissions fault in my car and reduced the power and limited the engine to 25mph. The car only has 15k miles on it. The replacement throttle body has no redesign. It\u2019s identical per the dealership and Honda. And no one is able to tell me if it\u2019s going to happen again. I used the same exact gas as every other car I drive, and I have driven in the same city environment for 10 years now. So it\u2019s clearly a design or quality issue.

It cost approximately $18,000 to repair the car and took 10 weeks. I also contacted American Honda to report the issue. I was told that I should call again after the repairs were finished and that additional testing would be done. I did call Honda after the repairs were done but did not hear back from them.

It basically dribbles onto the windshield, with a delay, and winds up getting dumped onto the bottom of the windshield and the outer edge of the wiper blade. The small amount of washer fluid that does get onto the windshield simply gets mixed with the debris on the windshield and dirties and obscures the windshield even more and makes it even harder to see out of. This is particularly dangerous when the vehicle in operation when the windshield washer is used and the windshield become smeared and obscured in traffic. The vehicle is available for inspection upon request Safety risk: Upon utilizing the windshield washer system while driving in traffic, the windshield becomes smeared and obscured to a point where the operator cannot see very well out of the windshield.

This put me at immediate risk of an accident as other vehicles were traveling at normal highway speeds. This issue arose less than 136 miles after my vehicle underwent recall repairs on [XXX] at Superstition Springs Honda in Mesa, Arizona. The recall repairs included: \u2022Fuel Pump Safety Recall (NHTSA Recall 24-049) \u2022CVT Greasing Recall (NHTSA Recall 24-123) After the recall repair, my vehicle displayed a dashboard warning on [XXX] stating: \u201cEmission System Problem. Power may be reduced. See your dealer.\u201d Following this warning, the vehicle failed to accelerate properly despite pressing the gas pedal, making highway driving unsafe. I took my vehicle back to the dealership immediately. The dealership categorized this as an emissions system failure but has not confirmed if it is related to the recall repairs. The dealership also stated that I would need to drive 500 miles after any repair to \u201cconfirm\u201d the issue is resolved, which is unreasonable and unsafe given the circumstances. This is a serious safety defect. A sudden loss of acceleration on the highway creates a high risk of collisions, injuries, or fatalities.

This issue is now under review by Honda Corporate (Case #[XXX]), but I have not received a clear resolution or assurance that my vehicle will be permanently fixed. I request that NHTSA investigate whether Honda\u2019s recall repairs are causing secondary defects leading to acceleration failures.

    "summary": "There are a few safety issues I've experienced multiple times while driving this car. To the best of my knowledge, there haven't been any warning lamps or indicators on the dash related to these issues. When driving, the car will activate the emergency braking system, braking incredibly hard at freeways speeds and street driving speeds even though there is nothing near or close to the front of the car. The car has braked so intensely that items fly around the car and that both my son and I have experienced back, neck, and shoulder pain from the unexpected/severe braking. The other safety issue I've experienced is the lane departure/keeping sensors going off on the dash and the car pulls itself out of the lane. It seems like the car thinks I've departed the lane and is trying to pull me back into the lane, but, in reality, I am in the lane and the car is pulling itself into the next lane (sometimes even when another car is next to me or approaching). This is a safety concern since it causes swerving and my car could crash into another car or a lane divider if I didn't react so quickly to overpower the automatic lane departure. It's also a recurring issue to have to fight the car to keep it in the lane and makes for very tense driving. The last issue is an electrical one, I believe, related to the infotainment panel. The power on the infotainment system goes off unexpectedly while driving. It sometimes will not power on during start up. If it turns off while driving, sometimes I have to stop, turn off the car, and restart it to get it working again and other times it reboots itself after a minute or a few. All of these issues have happened countless times, as long as I've had the car. I've had it inspected and during the most recent inspection (Sept 2024) they asked me to come in to drive the car so that the issues would be reproduced while the mechanic was sitting in the passenger seat.

    "summary": "2024 Honda CR-V VIN [XXX] Phantom Braking Car has experienced phantom braking numerous times since March 2024 when new. Initially occurred within one week of driving the new vehicle. Did not report it to dealer at first as we thought it was something that we were doing, or some sensitivity that the car typically exhibited. At random times car decelerates quickly as if pressing on brakes, or losing engine power (fuel supply, ignition, etc.), or downshifting quickly. After a few seconds car can be accelerated and resumes speed. In virtually every case it has occurred on dry, clear roads with no vehicles or obstructions ahead. Car, cameras and sensors were clean. Occurs when accelerating either slowly or rapidly. Occurs when entering a highway from an ON ramp. Occurs at 10 mph or 70 mph. Driver is not touching the paddle downshifter. Sometimes deceleration occurs multiple times within seconds after the previous - 2 to 3 times. Rapid slowing does not occur when in cruise control, or when manually increasing speed in cruise control. In all cases Red Brake warning light in instrument panel does not flash and there is nothing immediately in front of car. This condition is extremely dangerous, especially when there are vehicles behind, and they are not expecting my vehicle to slow rapidly. Occurs when accelerating to pass a car ahead. Or when trying to accelerate onto a highway to match speed of approaching traffic. We are always in fear of being hit from behind by unsuspecting drivers. We\u2019ve come to expect the hesitation/braking to happen and drive even more defensively. A log of events is available. _______________________________ Dec. 21, 2024 Picked up car from servicing at Honda City, So. Portland, ME. Went back and discussed incident with Service Manager. They suggested keeping the car for an extended period to have technician drive it and try to reproduce problem. January 15, 2025Met with Berlin City Service Manager to discuss phantom braking again.

The error messaging included \u201ctransmission failure, loss of power, emissions control\u2026\u201d. I had not seen alerts prior to this incident, and was not aware of changes in performance other than a recent, minor, decrease in fuel efficiency. Fortunately, I was able to safely exit the freeway & park in a nearby shopping center. My vehicle was towed to the local dealer, Marin Honda. After a week of evaluation, and consulting with Honda America tech support, the dealer reports difficulty isolating the problem and determining appropriate repair. At this time a cracked piston has been identified, and the plan is for a technician to use a barescope to evaluate the cylinder for damage, and the potential need to replace the engine. I am concerned that multiple owners of this model & year have reported the same problem, including loss of power while traveling at high speed (see CRV Owners Club) Their vehicles were also determined to have cracked pistons, with and without cylinder damage. It has also been noted that when the fuel injector remains open it may be a contributing factor to a cracked piston. Could this be relevant to the current recall issued for the fuel pump on the 2024 CRV? Whatever the cause, the potential for catastrophic engine failure places drivers and their passengers, as well as other drivers, at great risk of a serious accident.",

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 Description of incident: Saturday, [XXX] I was in traffic on I [XXX] near the [XXX] exit in Indiana. It was a stop/go, stop/go event as 6 lanes were going down to 1 lane. I was behind a Kroger semi-truck. I had my foot on the brake. I thought the people next to me had started to move, but then I noticed that I was getting closer to the truck (while my foot was on the brake). I pushed the brakes down further. I felt normal resistance. Nothing happened. I hit the cancel button of the adaptive cruise multiple times on my steering wheel thinking that perhaps my adaptive cruise started my movement. I kept rolling. Kept hitting the brakes wondering why I didn't stop. No beeps went off like they normally do. I rolled into the truck. My adaptive cruise had been set to 70, and I had used it before the incident. It was still on standby, but not green. My odometer was around 9547. This happened around 9:50am. No beeping sounds started or emergency braking happened. I would approximate my speed of hitting around 3-5 mph. I hit the truck. I had tried to switch to neutral and then to park. I could not move the gear shaft. I was hitting the brake hold. Anything to make me stop. Nothing worked, and I hit the truck. I did not move after hitting the truck, maybe one of the things I attempted to do worked. My foot was still on the brake. I pulled over, turned off the car, and restarted it. I have not applied the adaptive cruise since then. I don't know if it had anything to do with the incident, but I'm afraid to use it. If I had been moving at a faster rate, my safety and others would have been at risk. I took the car to the dealership. They provided me with a Honda multi-point vehicle inspection checklist and stated that they couldn't find anything wrong. There is definitely something wrong. If I manually apply the brakes, the car should stop. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

Pulling off the road, we were able to reset the brightness to maximum and just able to see the readout. This event continued to be repeated several times during the course of the day. We had less than 9000 miles on the odometer at the time. I have checked the fuses, battery, and battery connections-all are in order. This event again repeated itself two weeks later on our return trip. In addition, the fuel gage has failed to fully up date on the display after being reset at the pump. I'm concerned about the possibility of the computer being the problem. We have less than 12,000 miles on the CRV Hybrid. The danger to us and others is that we had no idea of our speed, fuel amount, safety warnings, turn signals, nor what other safeguards were not working. The car is available for inspection upon request. We felt that this safety issue was serious enough to report it nationally before taking it to the dealers, which we will now do along with the other safety recalls on it. At this time, it has not been inspected by manufacturer, police, insurance representatives. Upon completing our first aforementioned long trip, we have not seen the electrical problem repeat within the short distance we drive.

If you have not engaged seatbelts and turn the engine off, the emergency brake will not turn on creating a roll away hazard. This happened to me. I jumped in my car, realized that I left something in the house, turned the vehicle off, and without realizing, left the vehicle in neutral. The vehicle rolled out of our garage and struck another car in the neighborhood resulting in at least six thousand dollars in damages. Fortunately, there were no injuries. This needs to be standard in vehicles that do not utilize ignition keys as I am sure I am not alone in that my protocol has long been to take the key out an ignition anytime I exit a vehicle and this is the first time I have owned a vehicle of this type. Our Honda Pilot will automatically place the vehicle in park if someone turns off the ignition, there is no reason for this or, at the very least, an auto emergency brake not to be an option in CR-V regardless of seatbelt actions. This should be a simple software fix.",

Quite a disappointing experience from a serve department. I\u2019ve had Toyotas and a Mazda and was always treated very well by their service departments. Frankly this experience with Honda was the worst. It seems that Honda has had the mirror issue with other vehicles in 2020-2022 and recalls were issued. Therefore, it appears Honda is aware of the safety issue regarding the mirror.",

    "summary": "On March 09, 2024 as I was backing into a parking space, the rear vehicle wheels came into contact with the parking curb at which point the rear window shattered. The pieces of the window flew in many directions approximately up to 5 to 10 feet outside and into the rear cargo area of the vehicle where I had my dogs. Fortunately, there were no other persons around the vehicle at the time and my dogs were not harmed. Immediately after this incident, I called the car dealer where I originally purchased the vehicle, and was advised to bring it in. I thereafter brought the vehicle to the car dealer service center where they removed some of the remaining pieces still attached to the window area and covered the window with plastic. Thereafter I drove the vehicle home, returned with the vehicle to the dealer on March 12, 2024, and the dealer replaced the window on March 13, 2024 at which time I retrieved my vehicle and returned the loaner car to the dealer. The window appeared to be replaced with a different type of window than the original. I asked the dealer why this occurred, the response was that they did not know why and further stated that this issue of shattering rear windows occurred in the 2023 HR-V models, but they were not aware of an issue in the CR-V models. I purchased the vehicle on February 7, 2024 and prior to this incident I had no problems with the vehicle to include the rear window. The invoice from the car service center states that there were no signs of impact on the vehicle.",

    "summary": "Vehicle steering sticks and cause a momentary increase in steering effort that could potentially cause overcorrection and an increased risk of a crash. The sticking typically happens when the steering wheel is slightly turned to the left; the steering column and wheel automatically skip back to the right. It feels as if it is 'jumping' or 'skipping' a cog in a wheel. Initially this happened only on the interstate on trips of longer duration (I purchased the car new in July 2023 and first noticed it on my first road trip in November 2023), but beginning in January 2024, it has started happening regularly while I am driving around town on surface streets. At this time, I do not feel as if it causes a significant safety risk, however given that the issue has significantly increased in frequency in a few short months (November- January), I do have concern that it could cause major safety concerns if not addressed. I have not taken the car to the dealership yet. I have seen that many other owners of 2024 CRVs have filed similar reports with NHTSA and there are numerous accounts on ownership groups online, so I wanted to file my own. I do believe this should be a recall issue. No warning lamps or lights have appeared thus far. I am open to having the issue inspected if necessary. I will be contacting my dealership today.
