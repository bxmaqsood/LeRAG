    "summary": "I am not sure if you would consider this as safety issue but with the amount of drivers using phones while driving I see it as a major safety issue. When asking the vehicle to read a text message aloud via CarPlay it starts off extremely loud for half a second then goes so quiet it cannot be heard making it useless. Obviously it would be advise for the driver to not pick up their phone while driving to check the text message but that is not reality these days. This has been a problem since the day I bought the car and was told by the dealer they couldn\u2019t do anything to fix it until Honda did a software update. Three years later and still nothing. It seems there are tons of drivers who have reported the same issues but still no fix 3 years later. It\u2019s a major safety issue in my opinion for both the drivers of 2022 civics and innocent drivers who probably have gotten hit or could get hit from a distracted driver because they are picking up their phone and taking their eyes off the road to read a text because the read out loud function doesn\u2019t work. I ask the dealer every time I take the car in if there has been a fix yet and the answer is always no. Thanks for taking this into consideration! Honda has known of this potential safety issues for three years and has done nothing to fix it.",

My vehicle was built in late 2021 and was equipped with the same part as identited as failing in SB-22017.

    "summary": "On [XXX] the steering system on my 2022 Honda Civic failed as I was exiting the the city's inner loop in downtown Rochester, NY. Simultaneously, the entire dash screen lit up. It was fortunately a momentary failure and I was able to avoid an accident. I had purchased the car 9 days before, on [XXX]. In conversation with the sales rep., I mentioned that the steering didn't feel quite right. He suggested that I just needed to become familiar with the newness of it. I accepted his explanation. I was paying for a Certified Pre-Owned Honda, and felt confident that the vehicle had been fully inspected for any steering issues. The day before the steering failure, I notified the same sales rep that the car's maintenance signal went on. He suggested it was indicating an oil change, which would have in itself been an issue since the car was not due for one. After notifying the sales rep and dealership manager of the steering failure, the manager arranged for delivery of a loaner car and had my vehicle returned to their service department. The following day, he relayed to me that the service tech did not find a problem and questioned if I could be mistaking the lane assist technology as a steering failure. I assured him that wasn't the case and, again, described the flash of light from the dash that accompanied the failure. By this time, I had discovered online the Honda recalls for steering failure including the 2022 Civic. I also read driver reports that described the lit-up dash. The manager claimed not to know of any recalls or problems but said he would pass the information on to the service tech. I asked if the service tech. would know if the previous owner had the car serviced for any recalls since I only had access to current recall status. I'm waiting to hear back from the manager.

Instead of disabling itself like it should have, the system continued to operate. It often would detect vehicles intermittently, speeding up and slowing down randomly and abruptly. The worst incident was when I was behind an unloaded flatbed semi (again, it was dark and raining.) The car lost track of the semi and accelerated to my set speed. As I got closer, but not THAT close, the car suddenly thought I was much closer than I was and initiated automated emergency braking. It then lost sight of the semi and repeated this cycle a few more times before I turned off cruise control. There was no one behind me, or this could have been a serious accident. I looked in the owner's manual to see how to disable the system and was appalled to see that it uses a single camera instead of a radar. This is obviously unsafe in bad weather, and the system did not disable itself appropriately.",

    "summary": "When I tried to start the vehicle on 10/14/24, it did not start, however it started showing various messages on the electronic dashboard. The vehicle was towed to John Eagle Honda Of Dallas (Honda Dealer) on 10/14/24 around 11:15 AM. I am enclosing the diagnostic report run on the vehicle by the John Eagle Honda of Dallas on 10/15/24 which shows some of the messages I had seen on the dashboard. My dashboard never showed me low battery at any time but the car did not start and the message of lane departure, brake failure messages came on the dashboard. I have LoJack App service on my phone which tracks everything on my vehicle.I used the vehicle on 10/11/24 and 10/12/24 and there was no issue in the vehicle nor did I see any dashboard warnings. The dealer kept the car overnight stating that they were too busy on 10/14/24 and promised me that they will provide alternate vehicle on 10/15/24 morning as per my phone call. I went to the dealership on the 15th at 8:50 AM to pick up the alternate vehicle, the service advisor said I can take my vehicle since he had changed the battery and it was safe to drive and did not provide me the invoice for the replaced battery. I asked the service advisor for the diagnostic report and he informed me that everything was okay in the report. I insisted on taking the print out of the diagnostic report and had to wait to collect it. Seeing the time on the report I am able to understand that they ran the diagnostic report while I was waiting. After driving my vehicle from the dealership and not having new battery invoice in my hand I called Honda motor company customer service and narrated my dealership visit details along with being uncomfortable on the safety of the vehicle. I didn't get any help from them as well. They created a case number for me. They said that someone will reach out to me and no one has till date. If you need any other information please feel free to contact me.",

In getting it, i opted out on getting extended warranty for personal reason. However the car had 60 days dealer warranty. After several times driving it, i noticed that my arms get sore. I thought it was just the way it drives. I drove one of my friends car which is the same car same year and it just drives way smoother. Mine is really sticky. I have to really put effort into keeping the wheel straight. When i make slight turns, the wheel doesnt go back to going straight, it gets stuck, so i have to pull it again to go straight. I heard about the recall on this car about the steering. I brought it in to honda but they said that my car isnt affected by it and that my part was okay. Due to my schedule i was only able to bring it in until almost the dealer warranty expires. However, they said that the car was fine, that they didnt notice the issue ive been experiencing. They told me that it drove good and advised me to get an allignment done. By the time the allignment place was able to get me in, the warranty had already expired and so i was really hoping that the allignment would fix it. Unfortunately, it didnt not.

I loved my 17 civic that I had to replace (unrelated) and fell in love with the look of the new civics so I went through with the purchase. A week after purchase I definitely notice sticky steering when making micro adjustments while driving above 50 mph. Specifically when turning the wheel over the 0 degree mark of the wheel, there is noticeable increased resistance. I notice it while turning at certain points as well. The wheel also does not self correct very well. Say you let go of the wheel to allow it to naturally straighten, it will get stuck at times. I'm not that large of a guy, but I do go to try to stay active so I am able to power through the sticky moments, but it is certainly annoying and unsafe at times. For an inexperienced driver or smaller individual it could definitely lead to accidents. I really hope there is a recall for this.",

I purchased my civic 2 months ago purely for its reliability and the safety ratings given by the NHSTA. Honda has initially released the service bulletin to address their faulty replacement racks stating \"certain service part electric power steering (EPS) gearbox assemblies were not made to proper specification. \" In reality this is a LIE they are trying to say the scope is less than 5% of their vehicles but the truth is that every single vehicle sold with this same rack has or will in the short future report this issue, some drivers think it is only \"annoying\" and some dealers are telling customers its \"Normal\" I am completely appalled that there has not been a Stop-sale issued for this as the main component of a car is the steering and if that is faulty than what else matters! they have managed to put the same rack in multiple vehicles in the last few years and you wont begin to experience the issue unless you drive (few 1,000MI on the car) longer than 45 minutes. Civic Type R's are less likely to experience this as that vehicle uses a different rack (Probably more $). Owners who have gotten a replacement eps system are finding the issue to reoccur after 12 months. This points to the fact that not only is this a manufacturing/Quality issue but a PURLEY FAILED Engineering design.

Starting at 20,000 miles I noticed some odd steering behavior. Above 42,000 miles the steering situation got increasingly worse. The steering wheel would get stuck at a position and take an unusual amount of force to get it to change. This would occur normally at speeds above 40mph. It was most noticeable when making a minor steering adjustment after not moving the wheel for a while. This occurred turning in both directions and when driving in a straight line or \"locked in\" a curve. It was worst at temperatures 35-55F and once the car was driven 20 minutes or more. After 20 minutes it would progressively get worse. It did not occur at low temperatures around 10-15F and the steering was noticeably stiffer at these temperatures. It also did not occur when constantly adjusting the wheel around turns. However, as soon as the wheel was held in a position it would start sticking again. The problem occurred with the lane keep assist and lane departure safety features turned off; it appears unrelated to those systems. The steering would also feel odd when pulling in or backing into parking spots. It felt like you could feel each notch in a gear when turning the wheel. I was able to overpower the steering wheel. However, I hate to think of what this could do to an inexperienced or distracted driver. They could fail to adjust the steering or panic and put in too much force and loose control. It could also delay a drivers reaction time. This is a safety issue. I feel a recall is needed since this issue can be hard to reproduce by the dealer. There were no warning lights or messages.",

    "summary": "While driving and turning the steering wheel away from the 12 o'clock position, the steering wheel (power steering) will not return by itself to the 12 o'clock position after completing the turn. There will also sometimes be a force needed to turn the steering wheel past the 1 o'clock or 11 o'clock position in situations where the turn is sharper but does not exceed the need to turn the steering wheel past the 3 o'clock position. The steering issue only occurs during cornering situations and more frequently on banked turns. The steering issue occurs in both steering directions in the same manner as described above. The steering issue occurs with Lane Keeping Assist turned off. Lane departure notice is active. No electronic messages or indications occur during the steering situation that would indicate Lane departure safety systems were activating. Vehicle has approximately 50k miles. The issue has been noticeable for approximately the past 10k miles. I have had no repairs performed by any dealership to date for any car related issues. Honda recommended maintenance schedule has been followed to date. I have been informed by a Honda Dealership that the serial number associated with my power steering rack is not currently covered under the Manufacturer Recall Number YFW or NHTSA Recall Number 23V-704.The vehicle has recently passed State Inspections without any abnormal wear on tires noticed by the same Honda Dealership that informed me of the issue with the power steering rack.",

Issue seems to gradually get worse, the warmer the car is. Took car in to Music city Honda to be inspected, they test drove and noticed issue. Was unwilling to fix bc my car is just outside of warranty. Manufacturering errors/issue should be fixed free of charge!! Told me it would cost $3200 roughly to repair! The car was purchased from dealer with the issue! Called Honda Corporate to file complaint, and now filing here. This is really an unacceptable issue!",

It feels as though the steering locks into place which causes an issue with trying to control the steering as well as issues with turning the wheel while driving the vehicle. This is a major safety concern. I took the vehicle to Buckeye Honda located at 2615 N Memorial Drive Lancaster, OH on [XXX] regarding my concerns. Keith Vanatter a technician at Buckeye Honda test drove my car and verified my concerns of a sticking steering wheel and recommended a replacement of the rack and pinion. A service advisor at Buckeye Honda named Jacob Lang informed me after the tech verified the issue with my vehicle that the rack and pinion needed to be replaced at a cost including parts and labor of $2798.57 because my vehicle is out of warranty since it has over 36,000 miles on it. I was highly upset over this and informed the service advisor that the car is a 2022 model and I purchased it brand new in 2022 and should not be having this kind of issue with the steering. I informed Mr. Lang that Honda should be responsible to fix the issue at no cost since there are open recalls and numerous reports which Mr. Lang verified of 2022 Honda Civic car owners having the same issue that mine is having and he advised that my car did not show a recall per the vin. Mr. Lang advised me to call Honda America and speak with them to see if they could do something about getting this fixed or meeting me half way on the cost, Honda America advised no since no recall information pertains to my vin.

Leaving the airport initially I didn't notice an issue. But after traveling several miles at highway speeds, on changing lanes or making minor adjustments in direction, I noticed the steering wheel felt like it would stick, then release allowing the car to change direction, stick, then release allowing the car to change direction. This happened with each adjustment of the steering wheel. This did not occur driving at slower speeds. 11/2/2023--I had driven west from Miami Beach on Tamiami US Highway 41 and had entered Cypress National Preserve. I had reached about the midpoint between Miami Beach and Naples, missed the left turn to highway 94. Realizing I had missed my turn, I was driving about 45 mph looking for somewhere I could safely turnaround. I saw a road off to the left, slowed to make a left hand turn. While continuing to brake, I started to make the left hand turn. About 30-45 degrees into the turn, the car stopped responding to my turning the steering wheel. LOST STEERING. Car was headed for the ditch and guard rail. I continued to turn the steering wheel left but it had no effect. I continued to brake and slowed the car as I went through the ditch before hitting the guard rail. I did not hit the steering column, my passenger did not hit the windshield. The airbags did not open. My phone automatically called 911. A couple from Tennessee stopped to help us. This happened at dusk and it quickly became very dark. They stayed with us over 2 hours until National's tow truck arrived and then they drove us back to our hotel, 50+ miles each direction out of their way.

Higher speeds on the interstate with mild corners are quite scary because the steering wheel doesn't just turn as you move your hand...it will catch and then with more force, it will suddenly release. To Honda's credit, they are replacing the entire steering rack and EPS under warranty but there doesn't seem to be any design change to the replacements so if this is a design issue I worry this issue will just return later on.

    "summary": "The steering sticks when traveling at high rates of speed, on highways traveling between 60 - 75 mph. The steering sticks continuously at the high rates of speed on highways after traveling for an hour or so. A slight jerk on the steering wheel will correct the issue, but the sticking seems to get slightly harder to correct the longer the car is driven. The obvious safety issue is over correcting when the steering sticks could put the car and passengers in to other traffic, a retaining wall, ditch, etc. Another concern for safety is the sticky steering that gets harder to correct the longer the car is driven at high rates of speed, very likely, will become stuck and not allow the driver to control the steering at all. Honda dealership in Moss Point, Mississippi did a safety check for the power steering rack recall by Honda, and was made aware of the sticky steering and was given the instructions to detect the malfunction, but stated they did not notice anything wrong. To actually detect the malfuction, some time must be spent on the highway at more than 60 mph. The brief driving of the vehicle on a street riddled with traffic lights, for a few miles, by a technician, then returning to the dealership would not expose the issue. The test given was inadequate, and therefore inaccurate.",

It has caught my anttention multiple times now including everytime I use the lane keep assistance. The dead spot or sticking spot is still there with the lane keep on and it causes the car to not be able to maintain a straight line even with you giving manual inputs. In the last week this has become substantially more prominent because I\u2019ve changed jobs and have an hour drive both ways to work. The dead spot, dead zone or sticky spot is now noticeable going around a corner if you are holding the steering wheel in the same position for more than a few seconds, today I had the steering wheel feel like it was jerking going around a busy corner at a 4 way intersection. The last two days have been much warmer where I live and after 35-40 minutes the sticky spot makes it nearly impossible to maintain a straight line while crying down the road and a lot of roads where I live are long and straight and a brand new 1 year old car should not be doing this. Going around the long sweeping turn at the intersection today was kinda scary feeling the same dead spots as I had the steering wheel turned. It is clearly an issue and I have seen all the other reports of the same issue. I will be taking it to the dealer as soon as they will see me. The problem is that there are no error codes or engine lights and the Honda techs are not driving the cars long enough to have the steering box warm up and start showing the problems.

    "summary": "While driving at approximately 70mph on highway I-10 (west bound) in the Pensacola area, the steering wheel of my 2022 Honda Civic locked up and became very tight. The car has only 8,500 miles on it and is relatively new. I had to turn the wheel hard to get it to unlock and the car went to the right, the wheel locked again, I then tried to recover to the left and had to turn it hard again causing an overcorrection. The car went into a slide and eventually recovered. I slid into the left side emergency lane and came to a stop. I was able to get the vehicle home but it appears there is a mass problem with this model of the 2022 Honda Civic. The steering wheel tightens up so much above 50mph that the car can't be safely controlled. This came out of no where and the car wasn't doing this before. I am parking the car and contacting Honda immediately to let them know what happened. There have been multiple complaints about this Honda model and others have reported the same harrowing issues. There were no warnings, nothing before it happened. I've never had a problem with Honda so this is shocking. In my opinion, this is a major safety problem that could result in loss of life or property damage. These cars need to be recalled and taken off the road immediately....right now! In my opinion I could have been killed or ran into innocent drivers. These cars are totally unsafe and it is sad Honda isn't addressing the problem. Hold this company responsible.",

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 On September 17, 2023, while traveling at 65 mph on the highway, my car's steering suddenly pulled, resulting in a blown front passenger tire. The impact forced the car into construction barriers, damaging the passenger side mirror. Due to construction constraints, finding a safe spot to pull over was challenging, so I drove a short distance to assess the damage. Upon inspection, the tire was shredded, the rim damaged, and the passenger mirror torn off, with additional harm to the paint and body. AAA installed the spare tire. This incident wasn't isolated; recurring issues with the steering, including a September 22, 2022 incident where the car unexpectedly veered into a curb, had been ongoing since leasing the car on September 20, 2022. After the recent highway incident, concerns heightened when the spare tire blew out while awaiting a new tire and rim from the Honda dealership. The car was towed to the dealership, revealing extensive work needed on the steering rack and other components. Despite the car having only 11K miles, the dealership estimated approximately $8K for repairs. Investigating further, I discovered a recent recall, including my VIN. However, the dealership was unaware of the recall, and their attempt to address the issue did not align with its specifics. They stated that despite my VIN being included, my steering column is not covered under the recall. This lack of awareness, coupled with over 440 similar incidents reported for 2022 Honda Civic Sports Sedans, raises concerns about the manufacturer's understanding of the problem's magnitude. There is a defect with my car. Honda included it in the recall, should further investigate, assume responsibility and correct as part of the recall or manufacturer's warranty. Despite the ordeal, I am grateful for regaining control on the highway and safely maneuvering off the road without harm to myself or other vehicles.",

I have attached the receipt they gave me. There were no warning lights that have appeared or have ever appeared during this issue. They told me that the part would arrive a little over a week. I called back on October 6th asking when the part would arrive. They told me that they changed the order status to critical so the part would arrive faster. I was informed I would be called back on Monday morning. I called back Monday afternoon and was informed that they couldn't give me an estimated arrival time on the part. I was upset and asked for a loaner vehicle because it feels dangerous to drive and they told me they didn't have one to loan. I was then told that a sales person could possibly help, or I could trade it in. I was transferred to a sales person who listened to my issue and then informed me that I could trade in that broken civic for a new car and the EPS issue wouldn't hurt my trade value.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 I owned 2 of these 2022 civics equipped with Honda's Collision mitigation braking technology. This is the year they removed the forward radar and relied only on a single camera unit. I was involved in a rear end collision where I was the rear ender even with the distance setting on the furthest setting. The accident was on the highway at about 40MPH. A vehicle Merging on to the highway stopped in front of me in my lane. I was using adaptive cruise control. I can tell you the responsive of this system had me worried from in several other situations I was in. Not only did the adaptive cruise fail detect and slow the vehicle based on the vehicle in front of me, the safety system did not make any attempt to slow the vehicle and no detection was made by the system until about .2 seconds (or about 6') prior to the actual impact. I investigated the safety systems logs with a Honda mechanic by connecting a device to the OBD2 port and downloading the logs to a computer to verify indeed it failed to properly detect any obstacle until it was far to late. This seems to be a concern other Honda drivers have expressed as well with this revision of their Collision mitigation braking system. I believe they market as if this and the adaptive cruise system are features you can rely on to keep you safe and while I understand it can not account for every situation this was a perfectly clear day in Arizona at about 5:30pm in moderate day light. I believe this system is dangerous and has serious flaws that do not properly detect vehicles in front of you in many situations is extremely slow to react in almost every situation.

As a new driver, he did not recognize the steering problems that I DID the first time I drove the vehicle and this happened :( This is very scary for a parent but I recognize he may not have known different. Soon after I purchased my new vehicle, I noticed the steering seemed \"stiff\". I would be driving the vehicle and would feel like there was no power steering. I would be 'jerking the wheel' in order to try and correct the steering. I would constantly be gripping the wheel in order to steer the vehicle, even on straight, highway roads. I stopped allowing my son to drive the vehicle because of my safety concerns. I would attempt to set the cruise control so I wouldn't have to be 'fighting the wheel' and after a short amount of time with cruise control on, cruise control would automatically shut off for no apparent reason. This issues happened on multiple occasions. I took the vehicle to my dealer, over 80 miles one way, on multiple occasions. I showed them video of the steering issues that the passenger took when this would occur. They couldn't get the problem to duplicate. Finally after the third trip to the dealership, they submitted for warranty request to replace the steering column. On the fourth trip, the steering column was replaced. This is obviously a major safety concern!",

I waited 7 months for this repair. I demanded the dealership foot the bill for my rental car for the duration of this time, and they did. The part was back-ordered because it is Japanese, and assembled in China. It is a relatively advanced semiconductor microchip, hence the wait. The part nomenclature is \"Steering Gearbox, Electric Power Steering.\" I have put 3000 miles on the vehicle since it was repaired, and have not noticed any lingering symptoms of the initial problem. Car steering appears healthy. DEMAND that the repairing party honors the warranty. This is an expensive repair that dealerships do not want to pay for, according to most forums relating to this issue.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 I want to express my genuine concern regarding a recent incident involving my daughter's 2022 Honda Civic Sport. On July 4th, while driving her car after a brief rain, she encountered standing water that had pooled along the side of the road. Unexpectedly, the car pulled to the right, and despite her best efforts to steer away, she couldn't as the steering wheel was locked. The loss of control resulted in the car careening right, jumping the curb and ending up on the sidewalk. I am grateful that while frightened and dazed, my daughter and her passengers escaped any physical harm. We promptly brought the vehicle to our trusted dealership to report the power steering failure and assess the resulting damage. We were disheartened to learn that since there is no existing recall on the power steering system, the dealership contended that the accident must have compromised the power steering and, therefore, repair was not covered under warranty. I want to emphasize that the power steering failure occurred prior to the accident and directly contributed to the car's loss of control. The vehicle has a mere 9000 miles on it, and my daughter was driving within the safe speed range of 40-45 miles per hour. We made the conscious decision to purchase a new Honda for our daughter to ensure she would not have to worry about unexpected breakdowns or malfunctions. Woefully, as is evidenced through incident, that is not the case. With the gravity of this situation in mind, I kindly request your immediate attention to this matter. I believe it is crucial that a thorough investigation into the power steering failure be conducted, acknowledging that the malfunction predates the accident and that Honda is responsible for the subsequent damage and distress.",

    "summary": "My car is nearing 39,000 miles now, but around the time it crossed 30,000 miles, I started to feel like there was a bit of a problem with the car \"wondering\" down the road rather than easily cruising straight. It was a very faint/subtle sensation, so it was hard to tell what it really was and wasn't present all the time (usually only at highway speed). As time has gone on, this issue has gotten gradually worse and is now becoming a safety issue in my opinion. The issue is more pronounced now, and it is obvious that it is an issue with the steering rack and/or steering assist components. When driving, anytime that I've been travelling for a moment without needing to steer left or right any, if I need to put a small steering input (for example, on the highway just simply staying between lane lines) the steering wheel will not want to turn easily at first. Then, once you finally increase your steering input enough, the steering will turn, but it will very suddenly become \"easier/lighter\" to turn, which is problematic because the car will now jerk and it is impossible to avoid turning the wheel further than I need to or intended to. So it creates an issue of constantly swerving back and forth down the road and is obviously very dangerous. The best way I can simply describe this issue is the steering wheel \"sticks\" in place when it is held in a constant position, and then once it stops sticking, the quick change in steering assist makes the car very hard to drive without swerving.",

The front left tire was the one that went flat, and had I not been astute to the vehicles behavior, I could have been in a severe accident, as it is a front tire. I noticed the car pulling left a little, but thought it was due to the construction being done to repave the highway. After about 10 minutes of driving, I felt and heard the thumping of a flat tire. I had to drive a few miles to safely exit the highway when I heard the loud bang of the tread separating from the rim and hitting the underside of the car and wheelwell. For the tread to have been completely sheared off, I must have been driving on a flat for a considerable amount of time. The entire time, the TPMS never illuminated to warn of a flat or of low tire pressure. When I got to the dealership, the service writer told me the TPMS doesn't warn of a blowout. I found that to be a strange comment, because I clearly didn't have a blowout. The car was pulling for a little while (over 10 minutes), and then it started the notorious thumping of a flat tire before the tread eventually ripped apart. I couldn't find anywhere in the 2022 Honda Civic Sedan owners manual that states anything to support the service writer. Only that it measures even tire pressure, which it obviously wouldn't have had, so the TPMS should have come on. Even if the TPMS didn't warn prior to a flat, I think it should have illuminated when the tread totally separated from the sidewall of the tire, and it did not.

Happy to be home arms very tired. The next day I read over the owners manual for I do not drive the car often and followed the procedure to shut off driver assist. While driving after disabling driver assist the unit came back on by it's self with in ten minutes and would randomly tell me to brake. I did google this and apparently I am not the only one. Currently have an appointment with the dealership that I purchased the vehicle from.",

Is not associated with an accident, or other event. - Steering wheel / rack are \"sticky\" at any speed >20 mph, becoming excessive on the highway, where constant adjustments are necessary, as it does NOT want to stay true straight (not biased left or right) - Noise is audible while at idle and trying micro-adjustments left/right - When Lane Keep is turned on, the vehicle MOVES from the center of the lane, to bias greatly and ride the RIGHT line. If another vehicle is there, there would be contact. No fault codes, and the system remains on, even while riding the right line. - This is NOT SAFE, and more so on the highway. - There are NO fault codes being triggered. Honda does NOT have new steering rack parts available. They are backordered 6 months! There is no SERVICE bulletin available from Honda, yet, all the dealer technicians are saying they are seeing more of these all the time.

The symptoms of this are that the vehicle becomes difficult to steer. Even the slightest in-lane correction of steering results in over corrections and a \"catchy\" or \"sticky\" steering wheel. It makes the vehicle VERY difficult to drive and the entire drive feels like a fight. There is nothing relaxing about driving with the EPS out and the over-correction of the wheel is very dangerous. You must operate paying utmost attention at all times. This is a known Honda problem with their 2022-2023 Civics and some other models. There is even a class-action lawsuit against Honda due to this specific issue. We took the vehicle to the dealership for warranty repair, Honda did declare that the EPS system had malfunctioned resulting in a loss of power steering. They ordered the part and advised us that the part was backordered for THREE FULL MONTHS. When I asked them what we should do between now and then, they said to come get the vehicle as it was perfectly drivable even with the EPS out.",

Reason this is concerning is that when the check engine light is on the advanced safety systems are disabled. They had to replace the gas tank fuel filler neck because it was not closing properly. I was told by Honda corporate that \"this is not posing a significant risk to the occupants of the vehicle\", but when fuel is not being properly contained in the tank, and the safety features don't work I think otherwise. Now, there is a steering rack issue where at high speeds the steering is grabbing causing a possibility for overcorrection. Honda has known about our issues since June of 2022 and Honda corporate has been delaying official lemon law claims since December of 2022 where I then hired an attorney. Honda corporate is now ignoring the attorney and our only recourse is to file a lawsuit. I can't in good conscience sell the car to endanger the public.

While exiting the road, I contacted a right turn arrow sign and proceeded through the grass and down a slight hill. Although the steering was very stiff, I was able to navigate the vehicle slightly right. I came in contact with an embankment at the bottom of the slight hill. This embankment leads up to the highway that I would have been stopping at if I had been able to make the right turn and come to the stop sign. My momentum carried me up the embankment and across the highway. The vehicle finally came to a stop in the ditch on the opposite side of the highway that I had crossed. I'm simply reporting this incident to the NHTSA because I feel there needs to be a sense of awareness brought to this issue. Since my accident, I have read cases of this same occurrence on the '22 and '23 Honda Civics. I suffered injuries in this accident and my car was considered a total loss by my insurance.",

    "summary": "Shortly after getting the Civic in 4/22, I had two terrifying experiences with the steering. On the first I had to brake to let a car turn left and as I tried to enter the right lane to go around, the steering wheel locked. The second was on a twisty, curved entrance to a highway. Again, the wheel seemed to jam, and I had to yank it to avoid going on to the other side, this resulted in no grip on the road and I zig-zagged for a bit before being able to right the car. This continued to happen; but foolishly I adapted and learned not to trust the car. It was constantly dangerous to drive: the steering always unpredictable. In 10/22, the flashers were left on, and the battery discharged. All of the warning lights went on and the AAA person told me they would clear with driving. They didn\u2019t. In 12/22, I brought the car to the dealership, believing they could best fix the warning lights. The dealership told me that the rack and pinion was bent and that this was the reason the warning lights were on. When I asked how an 8-month-old car with 1600 miles could have this, I was repeatedly blamed. First, they told me I must have hit a pothole. I did not. Then they told me the car had impact accidents. It did not. I told them these things did not happen. But they told me to put in an insurance claim. I refused to do this and paid them to fix it since I was now clear that the problems with the steering weren\u2019t just something to adapt to, but something very dangerous. Despite my repeatedly asking for photos of the rack and pinion, the dealership refused to provide them. An added insult, they returned the car with a new knocking sound. I took it to my own repair person, and he had to tighten the bolts that they left loose. The mechanic told me that there was no way I could have damaged the rack and pinion unit and there was clearly something wrong with the manufacture of the car.

I do not lose complete steering control, but steering seems stilted, especially when highway driving. The vehicle has been driven fewer than 6000 miles. I heard on an ABC newscast that incidents such as those I had been experiencing were being investigated. I telephoned the local Honda dealer and was told that the dealership was unaware of any such investigation, but would inspect the car to determine if the safety features were working properly. Before taking the vehicle to the inspection appointment, I researched the news article and found it to be accurate. The dealership noted that they were not aware of any other reports having been made of these experiences. The \"head mechanic\" drove the car and said all was well as, in comparison to other Civics, the steering felt as it should. It was suggested that I might not be familiar with the electric power steering that the vehicle features.There have been no warning messages. Although there have been no direct instances of near safety risks, I am apprehensive when driving at highway speeds and am filing this report for documentation of my concerns.",

    "summary": "I noticed that when I would drive the vehicle on the highway there was something strange with the steering wheel. I felt that the car would not keep on a straight path, but would slightly start moving to the side and that I had to slightly adjust the steering to keep it driving straight. I would also feel a minimal stickiness of the steering wheel. When driving at slow speeds, I would hear a click on the front of the car every time I would turn the steering wheel. Also, there were random times when I would reverse from a parking space and I would feel another click on the back of the car. There were other times when I would park and the park brake would automatically engage. This issue started happening around November of 2022, about six months after purchasing the new vehicle. i just thought that this was normal, until I began noticing the increase of the issue with the unusual steering problems while on highway speed. The issue has been confirmed by the dealer when I took it for service on 03/08/2023. They kept the vehicle and informed me that I could not drive it until it is repaired. No warning lights turned on to indicate that there was a problem. I'm concerned that this is a new vehicle that I cannot drive, and the manufacturer has not indicated an time when the vehicle will be fixed. The dealer said that in May 2023 some parts may be released for repairs of this issue, but that they cannot guarantee that my vehicle will be repaired by then.",

    "summary": "I recently purchased a 2022 Honda Civic Sedan Sport on 3/24/22. It was a one owner vehicle with 34K miles. Upon my test drive I noticed the steering wheel was \"sticking\" and over-correcting. I mentioned this to the salesman that was along for the ride, we both said \"the lane keep assist needs to be turned off\". I have owned several Honda's, all with this feature so I know it can be disabled. Once I purchased the car and was driving home, I noticed it getting much worse at higher speed on the interstate. It was maddening! Going straight, without lane departure there is this constant sticking when any type of correction needs to be made. When you correct the path of direction, I have to push much more than I should to do a small correction but it causes the car to swerve! In any kind of turn, no matter how sharp the car does now allow you to \"flow\" out of the turn. I am forced into a constant \"jerking motion\" to keep the car in lane and not run off the road! The entire trip home was quite scary, not to mention I looked like I probably needed to be pulled over for DUI! Once I was home, I went through all of the safety, maintenance and settings options to disable ANY kind of Lane Departure Mitigation, Driver Assist or anything else (that's supposed to make the car safer to drive by the way) and it made no difference! I drove it again today 3/25/22 and had to get off the interstate because of this, as it is highly unsafe. I have contacted the dealership, I will be taking the car in on Mon 3/27/22 but after reading many forums on the internet, this is unfortunately a common issue of great concern, that has not been resolved as far as I can tell. There are no warning messages. From what I have read, when other vehicles have been taken to the dealership they are sent away with no corrections, as there are no CODES being given for correction. This is extremely unsafe, not for only the driver but passengers and other surrounding vehicles! The contact stated that the vehicle stayed at the dealership for some time while they tried to figure out what was wrong with it. The dealership stated that they were unable to duplicate the issue and that a replacement part would take months to come in. The contact noted that it doesn't seem as though the mechanic drove the vehicle far enough to duplicate the problem with the steering. The contact was told to take their vehicle back with no repair or solution. 1 Affected Product 1 Associated Document",

Each time any move is made with the steering wheel it is like it has to \"break free\" from being stuck. This happens almost all the time over 40-45 mph, regardless of the driving mode (sensing on or off). With the lane departure system off it difficult to stay in a lane when minor corrections to steering are needed, in traffic it becomes dangerous and very scary when the car wants to drift into to passing traffic and the driver has to continually fight the steering wheel. This makes for a stressful driving experience. We recently bought the car used (Honda Certified), it has 36,700 miles. We took the car to the dealership soon after purchase with concerns about the steering & safety and they said there is nothing wrong with it. We have since taken it on a long road trip, highway driving becomes stressful with countless close calls with traffic in other lanes. The car is available for inspection upon request.

It gets worse the longer you drive in one sitting. Usually it takes 30-45 minutes of freeway driving to start appearing. The steering wheel requires considerable force to move and it wants to move in increments. As the drive goes on the required force increases and a noise can be heard from within the steering column when you force the steering wheel out of its stuck position and turn. This is a safety concern because the steering is unreliable. The required force to turn is variable, and there is a threshold of force required to move the car that would make a defensive driving situation harder to manage. I am making arrangements to bring the car into a dealership now, but I have little faith they will have a solution to the problem, as it requires such a long test drive to even recreate.

It became difficult to stay centered in my lane. When attempting to make very slight adjustments either left or right, steering input was met with resistance, almost like the wheel was stuck in a notch. As I pushed through the resistance, the wheel would suddenly snap free, resulting in an over-correction. This issue was constant for the rest of the drive, a little over 200 miles. I was immediately concerned that this made the car unsafe, as the constant sudden steering corrections made it difficult to stay within my lane at highway speeds, especially in heavier traffic. The snap steering that resulted from pushing past the \u201csticking\u201d point frequently caused the car to veer toward cars in the next lane, despite my effort to compensate for it. My wife and 5 month old child were passengers in the car at the time. This would have been especially dangerous in slippery road conditions, though thankfully roads were dry on that day. The car did not display any warning messages or indicators. I ensured Lane Keeping Assist and Road Departure Mitigation were turned off, to verify that the problem was not related to any safety systems. But the problem persisted with those systems disabled. The issue did not occur during the next few days of normal driving, but it returned a few days later on a longer drive, after about 45 miles of highway driving. At first the problem mainly seemed to occur after prolonged highway driving, but in the last week both my wife and I have noticed the \u201csticky\u201d steering more frequently in everyday driving, both at freeway speeds of 60mph and at lower speeds (30-40mph).

    "summary": "While driving my car on the open highway, I noticed that the steering wheel became somewhat sticky and resistant. This started in September of 2022 and the problem has become increasingly worse. The steering wheel requires excessive force to turn at speeds above 40mph, making micro-adjustments to the steering very difficult and causes oversteering. If there is a bend in the road and I turn the steering wheel, it sticks when trying to straighten the wheel out. It requires additional force to break the sticking point and get the car straightened back out. The safety concern is related to the straightening back out, in some cases it takes considerable effort and requires control to not over power into crossing the line of the lane. I also have concerns of a lock up and causing an accident that could harm me as well as others. Currently, I am not driving my new car due to the fear of an accident. There are zero warnings appears when this happens, so there is no way to prepare for it. I have contacted my local Honda dealership as well as America Honda (corporate office) to complain about this issue. The dealership informed me that the steering rack needs to be replaced. Honda is not able to provide an ETA on the part, nor are they willing to provide a loaner car. Honda told us that we could pick the car back up and continue to drive it until it is repaired. Honda is not concerned about the danger to customers. Migliaccio & Rathod LLP is pulling info together to file a class action lawsuit since this issue is happening to so many Honda Civic owners. It should not take someone dying for Honda to resolve this issue with no expense to the customer.

    "summary": "2022 Honda Civic Sport current milage: 21,000 miles. I have had this car since September 2021. Ever since my first day of ownership, the LKAS system for assisting the driver with lane guidance constantly fights me. Often, the car turns the steering wheel by itself to hug the left lane line, often passing over the line and causing the Lane Departure warning to activate, shaking the steering wheel. This issue has occurred on the right lane line as well, but typically the issue is with the left lane line for my car. This happens every time I drive my car. I took my 2022 Honda Civic Sport to a Honda dealership about a year ago to look at the lane departure issue. The mechanics were able to replicate the issue, however nobody knew what to do as no codes were supplied by the car. The employees acted as if I was stupid as I explained my issue, with video proof, however their doubt changed when their test drive concluded. I was later informed by Honda dealership employees that the car was \"supposed to guide towards the lane lines.\" I am not confident that any car is \"supposed\" to do anything as dangerous as the 2022 Honda Civic Sport LKAS system; this issue will increase the likelihood of accidental sideswipes on multi-lane roads, or loss of control in poor road conditions as you have to yank on the very stiff steering wheel and constantly apply pressure to oppose the LKAS system. Another issue with the same 2022 Honda Civic Sport is that the ACC system malfunctions. For no reason at all, in perfect driving conditions and no warnings at all, cruise control will turn itself off. This is dangerous as I do not anticipate the deactivation of the system, leading the car to significantly decrease in speed on the interstate without. The system cannot be reactivated until the car is recycled; the vehicle must be pulled off the road to correct this problem. Nobody at the dealership knows what to do about the cars they sell.",

    "summary": "Factory Ordered 2022 Civic Touring Sedan summer of 2021. Took delivery October 27th 2021. Vehicle has 17,600~ miles roughly today. Around mid to late summer of 2022 I started noticing the steering becoming semi-stiff, notchy only in centerline position of 3-5 degrees on Highway driving. All driver aides are turned off LKAS etc. Tried with on or off. Basically, any speed in excess of 40+ mph, especially 60+ mph the steering wheel at random feels lightly stuck, semi-locked, resistive at center position or anywhere within about a 3-5 degree center position requiring a slight but constantly noticeable over steer to get power steering to engage properly. Makes highway driving annoying and uncomfortable constantly using wrist to make minor over corrections slightly right/left, left/right against the resistance. Car drives fine below 40mph. Alignment has been done twice to rule it out. Most recently this December. Dealership has been advised on my last alignment. Simply put steering is sticky, notchy, semi-stiff in centered position once above 40mph+ but not at every single time the vehicle is started. Mostly 60% of the time. I am waiting and would seriously like Honda to investigate the issue and release a TSB fix so I do not have to waste my time running around with the dealership debates BEFORE the factory warranty runs out.",

In this case the steering wheel( as well as the front wheels themselves) should straighten out as you continue to move. This is dangerous. Also, at highway speeds, in order to maintain the center of your lane small inputs to the steering wheel are normally required. In this vehicle, there is resistance to these small inputs. When the force of your input finally overcomes the resistance in the steering wheel the wheel turns more dramatically than intended(overcorrection). This is also dangerous. This also occurs with LKAS off. It's almost like LKAS engages the steering column preemptively above 40 mph but in a dangerous manner.",

No warning lights or alerts come in the car when this abnormal behavior occurs.

Within 2nd day of ownership, the cruise control abruptly shut off causing a safety risk of driver's behind me coming close to rear end collision. The cruise control has abruptly and without warning has randomly shut off over 40 times since then. Vehicle has been taken in for repair 4 times with no resolve. Honda tried adjusting brake switch on first repair attempt, did not fix the issue. Second and third attempts the dealership replaced the SRS module and the brake switch. Drove vehicle for 800 miles, then the issue arose again, causing the car to immediately slow, causing others behind me to have to brake quickly putting me at risk of rear end collision.

American Honda and the dealership states \"they can not fix the issue until they actually see it for themselves acting up\", which it does not act up when they drive it. I have many, many videos of the cruise control randomly shutting off and me being unable to reengage the cruise control.

    "summary": "My 2022 Honda, VIN [XXX] when in cruise control mode either Adaptive Cruise Control or regular, Cruise control mode intermittently shuts off. The Automatic headlight diming function also shuts off. There are no messages, warnings or codes associated with it. Attempting to reset the cruise does not works and the car beeps when it is attempted. The only way to reset cruise control is to stop, place the car in Park or stop, place the car in park and turn the ignition off and restart. The issue is that when in traffic on the interstate, when cruise shuts off, operator (me) may not necessarily se it when it happens. As the car slows unknowingly, vehicles behind may run in to the car or create unnecessary congestion. The dealer asked if I could video this and I did. The video was after it shutoff and my attempts to reset it. I provided this video to the dealer and they indicated that it was useless, though it was requested by them. I have had my car at the dealers' service center 3 times now and they could no replicate the issue. However the issue occurs intermittently and usually on long (50 miles or more) interstate drives which they have not performed. The issue started within 1 week of purchasing the vehicle. The environment that this occurs in has always been clear, no inclement weather, sometimes in traffic and others when isolated.

I called the dealer back about this and they said that my car is 11th gen so not part of this extended warranty. It appears obvious to me that this problem continues with this new 11th gen. People should be warned. This is a huge expense and it's simply unacceptable for a 2 year old car.",

    "summary": "On [XXX] the steering system on my 2022 Honda Civic failed as I was exiting the the city's inner loop in downtown Rochester, NY. Simultaneously, the entire dash screen lit up. It was fortunately a momentary failure and I was able to avoid an accident. I had purchased the car 9 days before, on [XXX]. In conversation with the sales rep., I mentioned that the steering didn't feel quite right. He suggested that I just needed to become familiar with the newness of it. I accepted his explanation. I was paying for a Certified Pre-Owned Honda, and felt confident that the vehicle had been fully inspected for any steering issues. The day before the steering failure, I notified the same sales rep that the car's maintenance signal went on. He suggested it was indicating an oil change, which would have in itself been an issue since the car was not due for one. After notifying the sales rep and dealership manager of the steering failure, the manager arranged for delivery of a loaner car and had my vehicle returned to their service department. The following day, he relayed to me that the service tech did not find a problem and questioned if I could be mistaking the lane assist technology as a steering failure. I assured him that wasn't the case and, again, described the flash of light from the dash that accompanied the failure. By this time, I had discovered online the Honda recalls for steering failure including the 2022 Civic. I also read driver reports that described the lit-up dash. The manager claimed not to know of any recalls or problems but said he would pass the information on to the service tech. I asked if the service tech. would know if the previous owner had the car serviced for any recalls since I only had access to current recall status. I'm waiting to hear back from the manager.

A police report was generated where II stated the power steering column locked which caused the incident, I informed my insurance company immediately and throughout the dealings with my insurance company and Honda Collision center I kept stating the steering column locking as the issue. I even reached out to Honda Automobile Customer spoke to Danielle and Casey at 1-888-234-2138 on 10/4/2024 at 3:36 pm in which I was advised of the recall inspect EPS part 23089. Honda Collision center advisor drove the car around the parking lot and made an assumption it was not the power steering column.

I have all this information in writing from both dealership. Both dealerships charged us a service fee for the diagnosis when we were just asking for the recall to be repaired. I filed a complaint with Honda an their investigation consisted of calling the dealership to ask what the diagnosis was, no actual investigation was ever conducted. Honda said they couldn't help us. The recall has never been addressed. They wanted us to pay $3000 or $4000 for the repairs, my daughter was the first owner of this vehicle. We find it to be suspicious that a brand new vehicle has steering issues after 2 years of ownership and coincidently Honda put out a recall for steering issues but it's not part of the recall. The diagnosis paperwork from the dealership we received specifically stated the exact same thing the recall stated on the Honda website. We need help.",

I am enclosing the diagnostic report run on the vehicle by the John Eagle Honda of Dallas on 10/15/24 which shows some of the messages I had seen on the dashboard.

The dealer kept the car overnight stating that they were too busy on 10/14/24 and promised me that they will provide alternate vehicle on 10/15/24 morning as per my phone call. I went to the dealership on the 15th at 8:50 AM to pick up the alternate vehicle, the service advisor said I can take my vehicle since he had changed the battery and it was safe to drive and did not provide me the invoice for the replaced battery. I asked the service advisor for the diagnostic report and he informed me that everything was okay in the report. I insisted on taking the print out of the diagnostic report and had to wait to collect it. Seeing the time on the report I am able to understand that they ran the diagnostic report while I was waiting. After driving my vehicle from the dealership and not having new battery invoice in my hand I called Honda motor company customer service and narrated my dealership visit details along with being uncomfortable on the safety of the vehicle.

Anyway, I went to a car repair shop, not the dealership, and they told me it was misaligned, so I got it aligned. However, the steering wheel kept doing the same thing. It pulls to the left ever so slightly and, at points, it gets stuck, so I have to constantly apply force in the opposite direction. It feels dangerous when driving on curved roads, specially at high speeds, because as I'm turning the wheel to one side, it sticks, so I have to constantly yank it in the opposite direction, and of course the car swerves a little bit. My car is available upon request. The manufacturer just told me that it was misaligned just like the people at the car shop I went to; however, I'm seeing more and more people suffering from the same problem, which is too much of a coincidence. There are no warning lamps, messages, or anything on display. And while the problem has not been confirmed or reproduced by the dealer, it's very noticeable when you drive the vehicle because it just seems like the wheels are not properly aligned. I have driven a misaligned car before, and the steering wheel never stuck like it does with this one.",

    "summary": "Well when I got the car everything was good until after a few days later after taking car off the lot. I noticed a stiff feeling when turning the steering wheel. Then came time for maintenance. I brought it up to a honda person at the maintenance office when checking in for maintenance before but all I would get told is they will take a look at it. Once my maintenance was done they would just tell me they did not find anything wrong with the steering rack. I stopped taking my car there for maintenance ever since then since basically they did not want to do any repairs. I have not been home at the residential address that shows on my records for quite some time I am away from home, no form of communication. So I am just finding out that this car has a recall on an issue that I think it has to do with what I would bring up to honda maintenance office employees before.",

And once the additional effort is applied, there is a slight jerk of the steering wheel in the direction the effort is being applied, almost feeling as if there were \"notches\" into which some steering component was falling, and that a bit of effort moves it from one notch into the next one. Even though the problem only began exhibiting a few weeks ago, it is noticeably worse today. It seems like some steering component is failing pretty quickly, and I am worried it could very soon become a safety issue, as the pressure required to move the wheel from one \"notch\" to the next has been growing.",

A week after purchase I definitely notice sticky steering when making micro adjustments while driving above 50 mph. Specifically when turning the wheel over the 0 degree mark of the wheel, there is noticeable increased resistance. I notice it while turning at certain points as well. The wheel also does not self correct very well. Say you let go of the wheel to allow it to naturally straighten, it will get stuck at times. I'm not that large of a guy, but I do go to try to stay active so I am able to power through the sticky moments, but it is certainly annoying and unsafe at times.

That should be the last thing on someone\u2019s mind when they get into their vehicle. All of my concerns, and issues listed above are for my 2022 civic. I had my vehicle looked at today, the dealerships look confused with this issue. They have to wait for a higher up to let them know proper information as to what\u2019s needed, the vehicle needs an entire recall!! As I said I don\u2019t feel safe and I\u2019m not alone. This issue is not being corrected the proper way.",

While turning through curves, the steering wheel felt like it would briefly lock into position and then would take some effort to turn it back on center. The problem has been getting progressively worse since then. The steering now sticks at lower speeds as well and makes noise while turning. No warning lights or error messages have ever come up. On March 30, 2024, I brought my Civic to a Honda dealership and the techs there confirmed the steering was faulty, consistent with Service Bulletin 23-037, and said my electric power steering gearbox would need to be replaced. Since the vehicle has 42,000 miles on it, the repair is no longer covered under the initial warranty. The dealership quoted me a price of just over $2,500 for the repair but said the part was on backorder and couldn't be completed at that time anyway. The service manager submitted a \"goodwill request\" to ask if Honda would cover the repair, but I have not heard back yet. I followed up with the dealership who said they haven't gotten a response from Honda yet either.",
