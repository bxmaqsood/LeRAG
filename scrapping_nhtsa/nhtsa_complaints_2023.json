    "summary": "The lower control arm of the passenger front wheel separated from the vehicle entirely while the vehicle was in motion. There are two bolts which attach the bushing to the front sub-frame assembly. These bolts pass through the frame and are secured into nuts which are affixed to the frame. The bolts are not captured; there is no retention device (pins, wiring) which prevent these bolts from backing out of position, other than torque. Blue thread-lock compound was visible on both bolts, which remained present in the bushing after the control arm separated from the frame. When the arm detached from the frame, it dropped to the asphalt and made a loud grinding noise. The passenger side front wheel became directionally unstable and rotated inward and left, out of alignment with the intact driver-side wheel. This misalignment, while the vehicle was in motion, disrupted steering control and forced the passenger front wheel into the fender, causing friction and significant further damage to the frame and the suspension. This damage, combined with the driver's actions, stopped the car immediately. Fortunately, this occurred at low speed. Unfortunately, the cumulative damage left the vehicle immobilized in the middle of public road. Due to the great weight of the vehicle and the unstable front wheel, the vehicle could not be removed from the roadway and thus blocked traffic for several hours. The bolts, frame, and control arm were not visibly damaged. The bolts lost torque and backed out of the frame without noticeable indication that they were doing so. Tesla's characterization of the fault was that the vehicle \"ejected\" the bolts. Tesla repaired the damage under warranty.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries1 Deaths0 The primary safety restraint system, specifically the driver's side airbag, failed to deploy during a significant frontal impact collision. This severely compromised my personal safety, as my head struck the steering wheel with force, leading to injury and pain. Had the impact been more severe, the lack of airbag deployment could have led to much more serious, potentially life-threatening, injuries. Immediately after the impact, the primary braking system also malfunctioned, and the vehicle's warning and autopilot systems became compromised, posing further safety risks. The specific airbag non-deployment problem has not yet been reproduced or formally confirmed by a dealer or independent service center, vehicle is currently scheduled for its first post-accident inspection at a Tesla Collision Center address 6010 Richmond Ave, Houston TX 77057 on June 11, 2025, and is available for inspection. To date, the vehicle has not been formally inspected by the manufacturer, police, or insurance representatives for these specific malfunctions. Police responded to the accident scene and filed a report, but no technical inspection was conducted by them. There were NO prior warning lamps, messages, or symptoms indicating a malfunction with the airbag system before the collision. However, immediately after the collision, the primary brakes failed and the warning system and autopilot system showed signs of malfunction/disruption; no specific warning lights related to these post-impact issues appeared prior to their malfunction.",

    "summary": "Description of Incident: I was taking my family on a road trip from Disneyland back home to Chandler, Arizona when our 2022 Tesla Model Y displayed a battery issue. We stopped in Palm Springs to charge, but the battery would only charge very slowly and capped out at 32%. We brought the vehicle to the Palm Springs Tesla Service Center, where they diagnosed a failure in the high-voltage (HV) battery and stated it would need to be replaced \u2014 a process that would take about a week. Given that the car is only two years old, I found it concerning that a battery expected to last around 10 years would already need replacement. We were provided a loaner vehicle and returned to Arizona. When the repair was completed, I drove the loaner vehicle back to Palm Springs (a 5-hour trip) to pick up my car. On the return drive home, I stopped at a Tesla Supercharger in Quartzsite, Arizona, but the vehicle would not charge. After spending over 90 minutes on the phone with Tesla roadside assistance, a tow truck was dispatched and took both me and the car to the Glendale, AZ Tesla Service Center. There, I was informed \u2014 again \u2014 that the HV battery needed to be replaced. I explained that this component had just been replaced two days ago in Palm Springs, and asked for an explanation. I was not provided with any specific technical reason for the repeated failure, other than being told that the battery \"just needs to be replaced again.\" Safety Concerns: At this point, I am deeply concerned that there may be a more significant or systemic issue with the vehicle\u2019s electrical or battery systems that has not been properly identified. The repeated HV battery failures \u2014 combined with the lack of a clear explanation \u2014 raise serious safety concerns for my family and me, especially given how reliant the vehicle is on this system for power, propulsion, and emergency response.",

Before she leaves the house, she had her front defroster on and the windshield was clear before she leaves the house. 5 minutes later, the front windshield became so foggy to the point she could not see anything in front of her and the front defroster was still on. And because of that so foggy windshield she moved out of her lane with no lane departure warning or anything and then she hit the railway pole without any emergency brakes going off or any warning signs letting her that she is about to hit something. The whole front of the car was gone and the car was totally lost but no airbags deployed at all and that was also concerning. Also there was no issues or any warning lamps or messages before the loss. The car was taken to a body shop and was inspected by the body shop and I believe a representative from my insurance company went to inspect the car at the body shop.

I did that yesterday, and I told him I thought it was something wrong with my car, and suspected I needed to take it in for service. He said no, it wasn't the car but that I needed Premium Connectivity ($10/mo) in order for my drivers to be able to unlock my car. He put me on hold and came back to tell me that \"it's a safety thing\" so that no one can remotely unlock my car. The reason I put 2 friends in other states on my profile was for them to be able to help me, as a single woman who lives alone and takes camping trips alone. That is not a possibility. Furthermore, I asked him about the sudden braking on Cruise Control and he'd never heard of it. He uses the auto drive, that they don't call auto drive anymore...presumably because of the safety issues. I think this car needs to be recalled like the trucks were. They are not safe and Tesla doesn't care. By the way, the car has 5G, but I cannot stream my music or listen to podcasts, to which I'm already subscribed, without paying for Premium Connectivity.

This is the used key card the El Paso Tesla Dealer was kind enough to give me, and help me program, when one of the original key cards, less than a year old, stopped working. (Tesla wanted me to pay $45 for 2 new key cards) The used key card stopped functioning so I planned to call Tesla and have them \"reprogram it\"...something that must be done while I am in the car. I went on a last-minute trip and took my spare, barely-used key card. I also had my phone but didn't realize I'd not re-downloaded the Tesla app when I recently troubleshot my phone. Later in the day I parked at CIty of Rocks State Park in NM, still without connectivity, and locked the car with the \"good\" key card. Then I misplaced the key card! I called one of my 2 backup drivers and asked her to unlock and start my car for me. Her App did not allow her to do so, even though it showed the location of my car at City of Rocks...it said \"move closer to the car\". (She lives in CA). I had to get a ride to Wifi, download the Tesla App, and when I tried using it to unlock the car, it said \"you must be closer to the car\". When I got to the car, I was able to unlock and start it using the phone key. After arriving home, I used my App to get Roadside assistance and asked for a phone call when they texted to confirm my location. I explained that I didn't need service, just needed help re-programing my defective card. (I had since found the good card!) The woman on the other end was helpful but it was difficult for her also. We ended up removing the defective key from my profile, though it required a lot of work and also required the \"good\" key card. I have to call Tesla on Monday (it was Sunday) to get the card re-programmed. Had my difficulty been in a high-traffic or unsafe area I would have been in trouble.

My car was in manual mode with the \"Emergency Braking\" switch enabled (no self drive or cruise control), the weather was sunny and dry and there were no traffic or obstacles in front of my car. The onboard dash cam briefly captured the incident. The problem did not reoccur for the remainder of my drive home. There was no warning prior to the incident, I believe that emergency brakes may have flashed on the screen ( not sure because I was busy reacting to the situation). The car has not been inspected as of yet. I now have to disable the Emergency Braking function each time I drive my car because unfortunately the system defaults to the on position and I don't trust it. This issue appears to be a problem with the system that provides visual information to the Emergency Braking System. I'm making this report because this is an extremely dangerous problem that needs to be addressed by Tesla before it causes injury or worse.

We called Tesla Roadside assistance. The tow technician reviewed the situation and said this should not have happened and it is a major issue. If this happened on a freeway it could have been a disaster. He also told us that he has to try to get the bolts back in after removing and breaking some of the adjacent plastic cover on the bottom of the car in order to safely tow the vehicle without additional damage. The car was towed after 2 hrs of breaking adjacent plastic next to where the bolts were supposed to be and trying to get bolts back on to straighten the wheel.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 I am lodging a formal complaint about recurring safety issues with my Tesla Model Y Long Range Dual Motor AWD, purchased on June 8, 2023. These issues have led to multiple skidding incidents under normal conditions, vehicle damage, and concerns about its safety and reliability. Incidents: Sept. 23, 2023 (6,279 miles): Suspension noise reported to Tesla Service Center, Clarkston, MI. Service concluded suspension was operating as intended (Invoice No. 3000S0008134598). Dec. 4, 2024 (29,425 miles): Skidding on a highway caused minor contact with another vehicle. Repairs (two rear tires and parking lamp) cost $1,007.28 at Grand Rapids Service Center (Invoice No. 3000S0011836159). Dec. 24, 2024: At 9 mph near a stop sign, the vehicle skidded, colliding with a cement pole, damaging the bumper and parking lamp. Jan. 9, 2025: During a service appointment at Ann Arbor, technicians experienced skidding during a road test. Inspection revealed worn rear tires (recently replaced), damaged suspension, and subframe assembly. Repair costs totaled $10,022.69, but Tesla denied warranty coverage. Concerns: Safety and Reliability: The AWD system consistently fails to prevent skidding, unlike older vehicles from other manufacturers like Hyundai and Toyota. Service Negligence: Tesla Grand Rapids provided worn rear tires. Previous services overlooked suspension and alignment issues, contributing to recurring incidents. Warranty Denial: Despite being under warranty, Tesla refused coverage, advising an insurance claim, which is unjustified given the defects and poor maintenance. Request for NHTSA Action: Investigate potential defects in the braking, traction control, and suspension systems. Recommend a recall if defects are confirmed. Hold Tesla accountable for repairs under warranty and ensure improved service practices. Seek compensation for emotional distress and service deficiencies. I hope NHTSA will act promptly to ensure public safety and uphold Tesla\u2019s commitment to safety measures.",

After the stop light turned green zi tried to merge again before my lane ended and the driver did the same thing by closing the cap and almost hitting the Zoox ahead of him. It also looks like that driver intentionally partially blocked the first left turn lane so I couldn't use it. I have everything recorded on my Tesla Front, side and back cameras. I attached the footage in the email for review. We should all be concerned if the autonomous vehicle drives this way or if it's learning from this driver's driving behavior. I wanted to add that I had my wife and infant in the car. There's a baby on board sticker on the back, driver side so the Zoox driver had to have seen it and still decided to run me into the cones unless I stopped despite I was already on the dashed lines merging in.

The vehicle then collided with an 18-wheeler truck on the right lane and came to a stop on the middle lane. I was driving past Tracy CA on [XXX] towards Modesto on a personal trip to Merced with my daughter, [XXX] , in the front passenger seat to drop her off. Fortunately, there was no casualty or injury from this incident. We are fortunate enough to have survived physically unscathed. A difference of few seconds could have led to significant injuries or impairment. Pictures attached show the steering wheel position turned to the left at about 160 degrees, while the front wheels turned to the right at about 20-30 degrees. For a right turn it\u2019s about a 220-degree position, which is not possible by a single swipe of the steering wheel. Please note, the front wheel position in below picture cannot be justified either way. The steering wheel and front wheel remained frozen in this position when high voltage battery supply got disconnected at crash. This proves the turn of the wheel, thereby the movement of my vehicle to the right was not caused by my steering wheel control.

I believe problem is autopilot did not disengage when car started to slip but instead it was still on until the car got out of the road and hit a large tree. This is 3rd time for me to have this type of accident with same situation slip then spin then out of the road. I believe autopilot is the problem here 100%. This autopilot system is very dangerous.

    "summary": "In August 2024 with roughly 7,000 miles, I noticed a creaking sound when turning left. This issue was intermittent and the sound was getting louder over time. I made a service appointment at the next available date (10/8/2024) at the Tesla Service Center in Fresno, California, and the service technician was unable to duplicate the sound on a test drive and refused to look at my car. The issue became more persistent and louder over time. I took my car to my local tire shop on 11/26/2024 because the car no longer felt safe to drive due to the loud creaking or popping sound when turning left. The steering also felt very loose overall. The local tire shop advised me that the right control arm was about to fall out and the car is absolutely not safe to drive and a major safety hazard. Therefore, I towed the car to the Tesla service center in Fresno California, and they repaired the right control arm under warranty and aligned the car. There were no on-screen warnings - just the sound I was hearing. Tesla ignored my concerns in October 2024 and their refusal to look at my car then could have potentially caused me to lose control of the vehicle and potentially get into a serious accident where myself or others got hurt. Since loss of steering is serious, it could have potentially resulted in death. This is a common issue with Teslas and it was absolutely unacceptable that they would not inspect my car in October when I specifically described the concern and said that I feared it was the control arms based on my research.",

    "summary": "This incident occurred repeatedly during travel from 6/28/2024-7/2/2024, the last time we had a passenger in the seat of interest. The right rear seatbelt kept tightening around the passenger to the point of extreme discomfort and eventually interference with breathing. The only resolution was to unfasten and refasten the seatbelt. The tightening effect occurred when the passenger adjusted her body in the seat or when the car experienced even minor bumps in the road. This repeated in a short cycle, approximately every 5-10 minutes, causing such irritation as to force the passenger to travel without the seatbelt buckled, despite repeated attempts to make the seatbelt operate correctly. This is obviously extremely unsafe--and illegal in many states, and in some cases negating insurance coverage, etc. Although this particular incident occurred in the vehicle noted earlier in this form, it also occurred in our 2015 Model S Tesla (now sold) on the right front side and in our currently owned 2018 Tesla Model 3, also on the right front side. We reported the original occurrence of the problem (Model S) to Tesla several times, and they inspected the seatbelt. There conclusion was always the same, as they stated to us, that the seatbelt was operating correctly, by design. We tired of reporting the issue. I know for a fact that for a correctly operating seatbelt, it may momentarily lock when bumps occur, then the lock releases. The seatbelts are available for inspection on request. There were no warning or error indicators presented in the car except the standard indication when the seatbelt was unfastened (intentionally).",

I had already disabled \"Apply Brakes when Regenerative Braking is Limited\" under Dynamics on the screen. (see photo) He showed on the screen, under Autopilot, that I could disable Automatic Emergency Braking, which I did. I was concerned that this warning pops up: \"The vehicle will not automatically apply the brakes even when a collision is detected\" (see photo) but he suggested I try it to see if it would solve the cruise-control braking. I was hopeful, and disabled it, knowing that it might take a while to know if that solved the problem. I drove the 30 miles home on the frontage road instead of the interstate, and when there were no other cars around, I set cruise control at 50 mph, the speed limit. I came to a series of small hills in the road, and was reminded of the first time the automatic braking happened, on a 60 mph road with longer amplitude hills of greater height. Amazingly, it happened again! Pretty significant braking and slowed me to 25. This time I waited it out to see if it would resume the cruise control at 50. It did not. I have since restored the Automatic Emergency Braking as that seems important for a crash situation. I have restored the \"Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking is Limited\" since that obviously was not the problem either.\" I did not use cruise control again until [XXX], when I happened to be returning home from Silver City to Las Cruces and was on the same highway, [XXX], where the problem first occurred. It is a 2-lane road and often there is no traffic, so I felt safe trying cruise control again. I set it at 55, the speed limit, and after only a few miles the car braked again. I do not use cruise control anymore, and was dismayed to find that Tesla is again offering a free trial of autodrive! This is a huge safety issue!

Much if it works very well, however I believe Tesla is aware of some specific short comings (because they have good engineers and are safety aware). 1) Lane ending merging gets an 'F' from several incidents: 1A) The most dangerous was upon entering the [XXX] from the Tesla Supercharger station at Yerma, Ca - [XXX]. The entrance ramp lane ends, and a pickup with a towed trailer happen to be parallel with my FSD Tesla as the lane ended. The Tesla showed no awareness of the impending collision. I braked hard to avoid the collision. 1B) In San Diego, entering a freeway the Tesla got confused while still in the right hand lane, and ultimately threw a critical error - something like 'autonomous steering system failure, take over immediately' with a red full screen alert. 1C) Merging on a freeway connector overpass with multiple lane consolidation, the Tesla failed to understand available openings and became confused causing left and right oscillations in the steering trajectory (at very low speed). 1D) Frequently is not aware of other vehicles as lanes end, causing unnecessary conflicts with other vehicles, and close calls. Tesla should publish a letter grade for the sub-features of full self driving. NHTSA should publish a standard list of sub-features - for example: A) Lane keeping with traffic flow B) Recognizing stopped traffic at highway speeds (i.e. sudden traffic jams) C) Merging cooperation D) Lane ending scenarios E) Maintaining single lanes (i.e. not darting across multiple lanes to achieve an unrealistic left or right turn). The success in many areas of FSD can lead to a sense of competence in the FSD, and to oversights by a human supervisor about what the likely deficiencies are.

Shortly afterward, additional noises emerged from the direction of the front left wheel. We are sure the car didn't hit or drive across anything before the first sound emerged. Upon making a left turn, we experienced significant difficulty in steering, accompanied by a much louder noise. We immediately pulled over and safely parked in a nearby CVS parking lot. Roadside assistance arrived approximately 50 minutes after our call, and the car was subsequently towed to the Tesla service center. As shown in the attached photos, the front left suspension arm detached, with both screw bolts completely broken and missing.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 Two days ago, as I was turning left into my neighborhood, I suddenly lost control of my car's steering. Just as I started the turn, the steering wheel unexpectedly pulled to the right, causing my car to veer off course and head straight toward the curb. Despite trying to correct it, the steering wouldn't respond, and the car collided with the curb. The impact was substantial, and the vehicle continued dragging along the curb until I was able to bring it to a complete stop. Upon inspection, I found that the passenger-side front wheel had been severely damaged, appearing crushed and warped from the impact. When I looked under the car, I noticed that the control arm was visibly damaged. It seemed bent or possibly broken, which I suspect contributed to my sudden loss of control over the steering. This experience has been unsettling, especially since the control arm is a critical part of the steering and suspension system. Afterward, I started researching similar incidents and found many posts and articles discussing similar cases. It seems that control arm damage or failure is not uncommon, particularly in situations involving rough terrain, curbs, or sudden impacts. Some articles also discuss the importance of regular inspections and the potential risks of worn-out control arms. I came across one particular article that sheds more light on these types of steering and suspension failures.

Along this route, this is particularly dangerous on banks, hills, and in traffic (even with max following distance configured) due to reduced visibility of the start of the lane markings.

Thankfully, in most cases, there was no one directly behind me or there almost certainly would have been an accident.

It is my understanding that damage to this component could prevent the airbags from functioning properly during an accident, so I am concerned that the car is not safe to operate with passengers.

The \"Auto\" detection is based on the front facing camera rather than any rain sensors, and is incredibly inconsistent. It regularly turns on the wipers in completely clear and dry conditions and often fails to turn on the wipers even in heavy rain. This would be more of an annoyance than an issue if it were possible to adjust the wiper speed manually, but it seems that the wipers still utilize some form of auto detection even when set to numbers 1-4. In this particular incident, I was driving in heavy rain, and had the wipers set to \"4\", the highest setting. Even in this setting, the wiper speed would often slow down regardless of the weather conditions, drastically reducing visibility in an unpredictable manner. At one point, the wipers, still manually set to the highest setting, stopped altogether, and I instantly lost all visibility and I had to emergency brake, as I could not see the road. On the highest setting, the wipers stopped for well over a second, and did not start again until I pressed the wiper button, restarting the wipers. It is one thing to rely on a proprietary and unreliable detection system when wipers are set to \"Auto\", but I feel it is a major security issue to deceptively allow this unreliable rain detection to override manual wiper settings set by the driver to the extent that the wipers may stop moving entirely in the middle of a downpour on the highest setting.",

    "summary": "On 5/23/2024 I gradually noticed a clunking noise associated with driving, more noticeable the faster I went (max 20-30mph). Concerned for a flat tire, I check the tire pressure in my car and it was normal in all 4 tires, no obvious flat tire externally. I continued to drive as normal. The following day on 5/24/2024, I was on the highway when all of a sudden I felt a huge change in the smoothness while driving. I shortly thereafter got a notification (albeit small alert on the screen) to pull over immediately, by the time I was partially able to reach the shoulder, my care was practically scraping on metal. 911 had to shut down the I95 ramp as I couldn't make it entirely in the shoulder. Until they arrived, I could have experienced a major accident on a very busy highway. After examining the car, it was clear the previous clunking noise was due to a missing screw of the wheel arch liner, which had caused it to be hitting the tire. This subsequently resulted in the complete destruction and blow-out of my tire. Replaced by Tesla and charged for the entire service cost. Now, 7/24/2024 another safety defect in the exterior fittings of my car. I noticed that the underbody panel of my car has been partially detached and has been hanging down. There have been no accidents or unsafe road conditions that would have caused this to have occurred. I believe another screw has come off of the fittings. This too could have resulted in a major accident. There is no obvious trauma or events in which these two product damages have occurred. Both in which gave little to no warnings and could have resulted in serious damage, injury or death.",

    "summary": "In May 2023, after I took my car from the Tesla service center in Santa Ana, I realized there was an issue of shaking and shredding from the motor, and it got worse when I pressed the brakes. That happened when I drove the car down a steep road from [XXX] down to [XXX] in the city of Laguna Beach; Then I drove the car to a different road from [XXX] , then down from [XXX] to [XXX] and [XXX] , where it is down steep as well. Then the same issue showed up, and I couldn't keep pressing break because the shaking got worse, so I let the car roll with shaking till it reached the straight road and stopped. Since then, I have started to avoid steeping, but once, it showed up on another downhill street, which was not as steep as the others. Still, it was a longer downhill, coming from [XXX] down to [XXX] till it splits to [XXX] and [XXX] . At that time, I did not have time to take it to the service because I was very disappointed with them after taking it for several issues several times. They never fixed them, and because I had my mother, who was in critical health issues, I needed to be with her all the time and take her to her appointments for her surgeries and wound care for several months until this year in March. Then I realized that the issue keeps changing from existing to disappearing to existing again. Still, instead of starting at a speed of 1 mile, it begins at 9 miles and disappears at a speed of 11 - 12 miles. It does not have a high level of shaking, but it still exists. I am unsure if that changes with the different updates they do through the air for the car. But the issue still exists, and the shaking levels change. Lately, they have taken it seriously after several attempts to report it and bring it to the service center. After nine days, they concluded that they had tried a similar car. This issue does exist, and it is normal when I have tried multiple cars, including their several demo cars at different times.

Last week while I was driving at around 70 mph on a three-lane freeway. All of a sudden, I felt someone is dragging my wheels to the left. I was totally astonished. My first reaction was to hold my wheels. Within a few seconds I was totally out of control and zigzagging lanes a couple of times before I finally slowed down and pulled my car over to the shoulder. I was in the middle lane and fortunately there\u2019s no cars on my sides at that particular moment. With that speed and that short period, I couldn\u2019t avoid to bump on others if there\u2019s any nearby. I was lucky that it didn\u2019t happen a little earlier on a bridge or a little late when I would be driving on a multiple-lane beltway with construction site in the median. Tesla roadside assistance came to put a new tire for me and cost me $600. I truly believe it is design issue. I\u2019ve been driving more than 20 years and this was my first time with tire blowout. Not to mention it\u2019s just five months new. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no any warning before it happened.

    "summary": "I reported this issue previously (11589255) and am providing an update: I took my car to the nearest dealer with my less-than-1-year-old non-functioning key card that TESLA told me I had to replace at a cost of 2/$45. I mentioned to the dealer, who is kind an helpful, about the automatic braking in cruise control. I had already disabled \"Apply Brakes when Regenerative Braking is Limited\" under Dynamics on the screen. (see photo) He showed on the screen, under Autopilot, that I could disable Automatic Emergency Braking, which I did. I was concerned that this warning pops up: \"The vehicle will not automatically apply the brakes even when a collision is detected\" (see photo) but he suggested I try it to see if it would solve the cruise-control braking. I was hopeful, and disabled it, knowing that it might take a while to know if that solved the problem. I drove the 30 miles home on the frontage road instead of the interstate, and when there were no other cars around, I set cruise control at 50 mph, the speed limit. I came to a series of small hills in the road, and was reminded of the first time the automatic braking happened, on a 60 mph road with longer amplitude hills of greater height. Amazingly, it happened again! Pretty significant braking and slowed me to 25. This time I waited it out to see if it would resume the cruise control at 50. It did not. I have since restored the Automatic Emergency Braking as that seems important for a crash situation. I have restored the \"Apply Brakes When Regenerative Braking is Limited\" since that obviously was not the problem either.",

It was very scary the first time it happened, but luckily there was very little traffic on the 2-lane highway I was traveling on. The Tesla dealer in Santa Fe told me they don't have a software fix yet and he simply avoids cruise control. After a few months I cautiously tried cruise control again and got away with it...but the third time, months later, it happened again. When the free month trial of Auto Pilot was installed, I did not intend to use it. Toward the end of the trial, I used it on [XXX] coming home to Las Cruces and realized it might actually auto-brake on the freeway, which could be a disaster. After that trip a Tesla friend shared his near-accident-causing experience with the cruise control braking. Another issue is that the key card didn't unlock the car, then wouldn't start the car. I called Tesla and was told I could reset the key card using the Tesla App, but it did not work. The next day I called Tesla support; he ran the diagnostics and said \"oh yes, your car needs to be re-booted\". He did so, and the key card worked to lock the car, but not to unlock or start it. I asked him to send me a new key card. \"We sell a set of 2 for $45\" (this is what came with the car). I told him I paid $53,000 for the car less than a year ago, it did not come with a charge cable, and now the key card didn't work? He looked to see if the key card was covered under warranty and found it was not. I have been unable to reach a person to speak with at either the NM dealer where I bought it or the El Paso dealer where I test-drove and attended the seminar, and have waited on the phone for exorbitant amounts of time while the bot tells me I can manage most problems on the Tesla app. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

Manual wiper speed control is difficult because the driver has to look at center screen and use menus to select a speed.

The automatic wipers are very erratic, sometimes running faster than needed or coming on when it's not raining to other times hardly coming on at all making it very difficult to see and making driving very accident prone. The poor operation can, of course, adversely affect the proper operation of the automatic driving capability too since that depends on vision by cameras through windshield.

I just turned right and had to take an immediate left to leave out of the parking lot. The Tesla was driving at approximately 5 miles an hour at that point. I lifted my foot from the gas pedal for the car to stop with its regenerative braking. However, instead of coming to a stop, the Tesla started rapidly accelerating, with my foot not even on the pedal. When I slammed the brakes, the car was unresponsive and continued accelerating. I started honking madly to warn people that I had no control over the car I was driving. The vehicle continued accelerating over 100-150 meters in 4-5 seconds and banged a parked car (Lexus SUV) at the end of the parking lot. It continued accelerating while pushing Lexus over the curb, destroying road sign poles and landscaping shrubs; crossing the street, and the middle curb. At the end of the street was a tree and a ditch. Lexus couldn\u2019t move any further and Tesla stopped. All airbags deployed. One of the emergency response detection systems called 911 immediately. The first thing the police asked me was if I pressed the emergency brake. I said the car doesn\u2019t have one. I can\u2019t even turn off the vehicle while it is moving. The parking button takes care of it. I used to love my Tesla but I can\u2019t trust it anymore. What I want from them at this time is: Investigate all the incidents thoroughly instead of blaming these as a user error. a) Think about adding the redundancy system. Something mechanical where the driver reacts within a couple of seconds. Software bugs are hard and sometimes it is impossible to find the root cause. Logs may not contain everything that you need to debug the problem. Consider it as a P0 issue. b) Compensate for the damage and property loss.",

    "summary": "You have no doubt heard the news that Tesla has deployed Full Self Driving to all its vehicles as a \"free trial.\" My Tesla received this update in the past few days. Last night I was driving on an expressway and engaged what has up until now been traffic-aware cruise control by pressing down one time on the right stalk. I expected regular cruise control but the car started steering for me. Tesla has changed the default behavior of the cruise control activation (one single downward press on the stalk) to instead activate Autopilot. My attempt to regain control caused me to jerk the wheel side to side in a way that could have led to an accident had I been in heavier traffic. This was unexpected behavior from the vehicle and I find it unacceptable that Tesla has changed a default function in this manner. I had to hunt around on the screen to find the setting to change the behavior back to regular Traffic Aware Cruise Control from one downward press. Furthermore, on the same 20 mile trip I had three phantom braking incidents while the car was on Traffic Aware Cruise Control mode. This is more than typical and these events can be dangerous if they happen in traffic. Tesla should not be allowed to deploy changes, especially without notice, that modify basic functionality of a car in motion from what the driver has become accustomed to.",

    "summary": "I want to report what I think is a very dangerous issue with my Tesla Model Y. We have experienced numerous times that the car brakes without warning. I have talked to Tesla about this \"phantom braking\", and they say it is \"normal\". The Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cannot be disabled to create a normal manual cruise control. I gave them a hypothetical situation where this could be life-threatening, but they dismissed it. Two weeks later, that very scenario happened, thankfully not ending in tragedy. I was driving at 65 mph on a wide, two lane paved highway (near Dove Creek, CO). A car going in the opposite direction was stopped on the shoulder on the other side of the highway. A large semi truck, also going in the opposite direction, pulled into my lane to pass the parked car on the side of the road. I saw what was happening, let off the accelerator, and steered over onto the paved shoulder (wide shoulder) to avoid the oncoming truck. My car's Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, using the car's cameras, interpreted the situation as an apparent collision danger and automatically braked hard. In this situation there was a large pickup doing what most pickup drivers do.... tailgating close behind me to get me to drive faster. Neither the driver of the pickup, nor me, were expecting my car to brake hard, as we had all assessed the situation correctly as not being dangerous. I responded as quickly as I could by pushing on the accelerator to cancel the cruise control, but the pickup almost rear ended me. At that speed, it could easily have turned into a fatal accident. Tesla says I can't disable the cameras, so I just don't use the cruise control now. I was told you can disable the \"traffic-aware\" part of cruise control on older model Teslas, but not 2023 and newer. Often the phantom braking occurs with no apparent reason (although the car's cameras and computer would probably disagree). Do many people have to be killed to take a safety hazard seriously?",

The AEB, based on TESLA manual and instructions should have kicked in, but it never did. After the accident, a friend of mine told me about AEB function and the fact that it works in those type of conditions, I tested the car in my driveway (I have a pretty long driveway to do this). AEB did not kick in until I turned off the function and I turned on the function again. Then, it kicked in immediately, and on the screen \"A\" showed, which means AEB kicked in. That was the first time AEB worked and that sign appeared on the screen. Later in the day, when I tested the car again under the exact same conditions,, AEB stopped functioning again like the way it has been since I bought the car. I read all the information/instructions regarding AEB. I understand that in certain conditions like, if the driver is accelerating or putting pressure on brake pedal or steering wheel, AEB does not kick in. I talked to another TESLA owner, he said his does not kick in either unless the car is on auto cruise or autopilot. Mine is the same. This is definitely malfunction. The issue is that the car, on the screen shows that AEB is always turned on, but it never kicks in and the car does not give any error regarding this issue. Again, I tested it after turning off and on AEB function, and I now know the difference. Under the same conditions of that testing, the AEB does not function at all. The accident I had was 100% preventable if AEB worked properly. TESLA Service Center has been dismissive. They send me snippets from the TESLA manual, which I already have and read many times. They say they cannot test it. All they can do is to check remotely to see if the function is on, but that's where the issue is. The function is always on, but it never kicks in.

Sometimes the cruise control set speed is unchanged, and pushing the accelerator will cause the car to resume the set speed. Yesterday I drove 320 miles and had about 6 of these events. I'm concerned about these events causing an accident from the sudden speed reduction, or getting into a road rage situation because the person behind me thinks I am brake-checking them. Internet research indicates that these complaints are very common during the past few years. If Tesla can't - or doesn't want to - solve the problem, they should at least allow us to choose basic cruise control to avoid this problem. Adaptive cruise control would be more reliable with radar, but Tesla is doing everything it can to make the cars cheaper, and radar was eliminated.

This policy, which I understand may have been implemented with safety intentions, paradoxically compromises my safety and potentially that of others. My experience with the system has shown that the warnings are overly sensitive, activating even while I am fully attentive and engaged with the driving process. The result is the Auto Steer feature\u2014a tool I rely on for enhancing my driving safety\u2014being disabled for an entire week after these strikes. This blanket punishment is applied universally across all driver profiles, disregarding individual driving contexts and histories. The logic behind this stringent measure seems counterintuitive. The Auto Steer function, in my experience, significantly increases safety by aiding in maintaining lane integrity, adjusting speed, and managing distance from other vehicles. Disabling it not only diminishes my vehicle's capability but also impacts my confidence in the vehicle's safety features, which I have come to depend on. I urge the NHTSA to reconsider this mandate and recommend adjustments. Possible improvements could include making the warning alerts more prominent to aid drivers in real-time, allowing for a more interactive and educational approach to enhancing driving habits. Alternatively, revisiting the policy to provide drivers with more control and flexibility over the use of Auto Steer could be beneficial, ensuring that it serves its intended purpose of augmenting safety without unwarranted restrictions. The overarching goal should be to enhance safety while also respecting the drivers' ability to utilize technology responsibly. I hope for a revision of this policy that aligns more closely with the practical needs and safety interests of Tesla drivers. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",

I was told by technician that if this wire chewed by rodent or broken, passenger air bag will not function at all when there is an impact or an accident. I'm not really sure whether the driver will be even alerted whenever this wire is broken. This is simply a design fault because such an important wire should not be placed in a vulnerable location where rodent can chew it. I have never come across this in any car in my life so far. (2). If an airbag does not function, a passenger could get hurt or die (3). I asked the service team about the design fault and filled their service visit survey as well, but no one answered me so far. (4). Service technicians inspected the broken electrical wire, repaired it, but there is no guarantee that rodent can not chew it again because repaired wire is at the same place as before. (5). There is no prior warning for me. Service technicians came over to replace the passenger seat. Once they replaced it, the senior technician tried to check all the system using his laptop and it appeared that he noticed a fault on his laptop screen. So, he opened the frunk and found the broken wire. (6). Instead of replacing this part with OEM part he repaired it and even charged me for the cost of repair though my car is under warranty. This is the design fault and this wire can be chewed again and manufacture can keep charging the customers till the life of the car.",

    "summary": "On almost a daily basis, with the cruise control set to maintain speed (vs the option of advanced speed control that will adjust to signs), the car will inexplicably and quite randomly decelerate aggressively at highway speeds. On four separate occasions just today (although it happens at least once or twice a day), with the cruise set to 70 MPH, the car will randomly decelerate aggressively or even change the max speed of the cruise to 55 MPH. On all occasions, the posted speed limit is 65 or even 75 mph. This is dangerous, particularly in DFW traffic during rush hours, with traffic flow moving at similar and often higher speeds in close proximity. Having my car aggressively decelerate without warning to 55 MPH has caused me to be tailgated and honked at. This has been happening since I've received my car. At first, I tried to use the advanced features of the cruise, but whilst driving on the Dallas Tollways, where the toll road has a speed limit of 75 MPH and the regular highway paralleling at 65, the car is unable to differentiate and would often interpret the wrong speed limit and aggressively brake. Going from the flow of traffic (close to 80 MPH) to 65. This is why I switched the cruise to absolute speed rather than any sort of posted adaptive. It's seems to have gotten progressively worse. So much so that I only use the cruise where traffic is light because of this issue's unexpected and random nature. Besides being dangerous, it's also very scary as it's completely unexpected and aggressive. I did make a service support call, but the Tesla technician said it's a known issue and no data available if/when it may be fixed. Currently, car is running software v11.1 2024.2.3",

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries6 Deaths0 The Facts of the Incident: On [XXX], at approximately [XXX] PM, [XXX] , was driving our 2023 Tesla Model Y on Arizona State Route [XXX] ), a two-lane highway, enroute from Orange, California, to the Grand Canyon South Rim. The vehicle carried a total of four passengers, including my wife, myself, and another couple from San Diego. During our journey, an alarming and life-threatening situation unfolded. Without warning, our 2023 Tesla Model Y abruptly veered to the left, dangerously encroaching into oncoming traffic. Despite my immediate attempts to regain control by steering the vehicle away from the oncoming traffic, the steering wheel became unresponsive, effectively locking in place. This mechanical or software malfunction prevented me from correcting the perilous situation, resulting in a head-on collision with a large Ford 350 Truck, which was also traveling at a high speed, estimated to be more than 60 miles per hour. Fortunately, while there were injuries, there didn\u2019t appear to be any life threating injuries. Because of the resources required to further investigate and do an analysis of the vehicle, as well as the challenge of dealing with Tesla Inc., law firms have declined to pursue further investigations. Morgan and Morgan initially started an investigation with Knott, LLC, Arizona, but then dropped the pursuit due to costs. The vehicle is still on-hold by my insurance company, USAA, but they may not hold it much longer before placing it on auction. However, it is urgent that NHTSA take possession and complete further analysis of this vehicle. Your assistance and consideration are appreciated, and I look forward to assisting with this investigation.

I got the car fixed and after 2 months same thing happened [XXX] with same message and car stopped working and only gave a minute to park. The car is in repair shop with Tesla. This raises a serious safety issue where the driver only has a minute or two to take the car off of the road and park at safe location. Imagine if you are on a busy highway and you only have a minute to pull it on the side. You might be stuck in the middle of the road and waiting for someone to hit your car. NHTSA needs to closely look at it and take up the issue with Tesla and also raise the question on the quality of car produced.

    "summary": "To Whom It May Concern at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), I am writing to urgently express my concerns about the latest software update for the Tesla Model Y\u2019s autopilot system, which, in my view, significantly compromises safety. As a Model Y owner, I have generally found the vehicle and its features to be reliable and safe. However, the recent update has introduced an overly stringent hands-on-wheel detection mechanism that is not only inconvenient but also potentially hazardous. The new update requires frequent and often forceful interaction with the steering wheel to assure the system of driver presence. This change is drastically different from my previous experience, where I received only one hands-on-wheel violation in two years. The current sensitivity of the system disrupts the smooth operation of the autopilot, leading to frequent and abrupt disengagements. I have found myself struggling to maintain the system\u2019s activation, inadvertently causing the vehicle to exit autopilot mode multiple times. This issue goes beyond mere inconvenience; it actively detracts from driving safety. The need for constant and sometimes aggressive adjustments to satisfy the system\u2019s requirements is distracting and can lead to erratic vehicle behavior. The irony is stark: a system designed to enhance driving safety and ease is now a source of potential danger and stress. The unpredictability and over-sensitivity of the updated system could lead to dangerous situations, especially on highways or in heavy traffic, where sudden disengagement of the autopilot can be particularly risky. As a driver, I now find myself more focused on keeping the autopilot engaged than on the actual driving conditions and surroundings, which is surely contrary to the feature\u2019s intended purpose. I urge the NHTSA to investigate this issue as a matter of urgency.",

    "summary": "To whom it may concern. The Tesla auto pilot feature was substantially altered recently because of a recall and reports of driver misuse. Auto pilot is inherently a safety feature - under auto pilot the driver is assisted to navigate while being protected by collision avoidance. It also substantially reduces driver fatigue by relieving the driver of the duty to clutch the wheel. We are aware some drivers have abused this system or misused it by not attending to the driving task - and we support efforts to manage this behavior. However, the changes forced upon Tesla drivers have ruined autopilot - in both ineffective and illogical ways. Frequent alerts take driver attention OFF the road, including being chastised for looking at prior alerts. Many drivers will simply no longer use it. The consequence of ruining the driver autopilot experience has bad consequences for safely. To my knowledge, ~40,000 people died in automobile accidents in a typical year, and that number is rising as more drivers are distracted by cell phone use. Most of the deaths can be related to driver error. Advanced driver assistance features are the obvious answer. A few anomalies should not deter policy from missing the value of advanced assist features. Please let Tesla engineers return to more balanced alert mechanisms and pursue other more effective means of detecting and curtailing abuse. Far more deaths will occur if autopilot and other advanced systems are curtailed because features are rendered useless by restrictions the mostly punish safe drivers. Thank you.",

Rather than promote and work with Tesla to create a future where technology can meaningfully assist drivers on the road and reduce fatalities and car crashes, this department is doing its best to ensure that no progress is made.

It was raining hard and the wipers were set to Auto.

There was not another car in front of us and TACC (but not autosteer) was on. All of a sudden a loud alarm sound blared, a FCW appeared on the display, and the car slowed to about 35 mph.

    "summary": "The incident: The vehicle moved forward when put in reverse, multiple times on one occasion. Details: At approximately 14:00 on 1/14/24, I parked the vehicle on a driveway that is on a hill. Normal terrain where I reside. As I was leaving 15 minutes later I put the vehicle in drive to get out but I also had to reverse in order get back into the street properly. I then put the car in reverse, and the car started moving forward. I put the car back in park, puzzled. I then carefully put it again in reverse, the car still went forward. This happened four or five times: remove the car from park, then put the car in reverse and the vehicle would move forward instead. In front of me was a fence and a tree and I could not keep going forward. I had a passenger in the vehicle who witnessed all of this and attempted to help by going in front of the vehicle to make I would not hit the wall/tree as the car would only go forward when in reverse. Eventually, after three or so minutes, I put the car in park, then neutral and then in reverse, finally the vehicle moved as it should have. Conclusion: It is hard to tell what component of the system malfunctioned. On the screen, the vehicle would show that it was in reverse by highlighting the \"R\" but the vehicle would still move forward instead. The vehicle has not yet been inspected by the manufacturer but that has been arranged. With a simple search online, it is apparent that this issue has occurred many times to others with the same model vehicle. This incident was extremely alarming because when a car is supposed to do one action and does the complete opposite, people's lives are put at risk. This is never supposed to happen. When put in reverse a car should reverse not go forward, simple as that.",

I have encountered two major issues with the vehicle and the customer service. First, I was promised by Tesla representatives that I would receive six months of free Supercharging after delivery, as part of a referral program. However, this offer has not been activated yet. When I contacted Tesla, one of the supervisors told me that I was not eligible for this offer, because I placed my order on September 23, before the program started. This is unacceptable, as I was assured multiple times by Tesla agents that they would honor the offer and match it before delivery. I also offered to take back my self-driving capability which is available to me for free for the first 3 months. Second, I have experienced serious problems with the auto-pilot feature of the vehicle. I have used it four times briefly in the last month, and every time the car slowed down significantly when it was supposed to cruise at 50 mph. Twice, I had to avoid rear collisions by pressing the accelerator or the brakes. I reported these incidents to Tesla through the app, but I have not received any response or explanation. The most alarming event occurred on December 26, when I was with my family on a return trip from IKEA in Woodbridge, VA. The weather was bad and the Tesla suddenly stopped on the road. I suspect that the front camera falsely detected an obstacle and caused the car to brake abruptly. These issues are not only frustrating, but also dangerous and potentially life-threatening. I am very disappointed with the quality and performance of the Tesla Model Y, as well as the lack of customer support and accountability. I request that Tesla either provide me with a satisfactory solution or compensate me for the inconvenience and risk that I have endured. I have a legal background and I am aware of my rights and remedies under the Lemon Law and other consumer protection laws.",

    "summary": "This is to inform you of the incomplete tow package that Tesla sells/installs as a factory option on Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. The 12 volt auxiliary power pin on the standardized 7 pin trailer wiring plug/outlet is non-functional, and this can pose a significant hazard to the vehicle, other vehicle, and surroundings when trailers equipped with electric brakes are towed. The hazard is that certain weight ranges of trailers are required to have electric trailer brakes and, in case the trailer breaks away from the tow vehicle, the trailer is required to have a built-in battery that provides the power to actuate the brakes. This battery gets recharged ONLY when it is plugged into a tow vehicle, and it gets its recharging current from the 12 volt auxiliary power pin which Tesla has delivered without any power whatsoever being supplied. The hazard: Anyone using a Tesla Model Y or 3 to tow a trailer with electric brakes will NEVER be getting the trailer's battery recharged. Once the trailer battery goes flat there will be NO EMERGENCY BRAKE ACTIVATION if the trailer detaches from the tow vehicle. My understanding is that when Tesla switched from a standard 12v lead-acid battery to a 16 volt lithium battery it became necessary to include an electrical component to reduce the voltage to 12 volts which has been the automotive standard for decades. Tesla did NOT provide this component to provide 12 volts to the trailer outlet's Auxiliary Power pin - instead, they just left it dead. Tesla made this change in the spring of 2022. People immediately noticed and asked for a fix, to which Tesla replied that it would be coming \"soon\". My August 2023 build Model Y has the dead Aux Power pin, and when I submitted a warranty claim they replied that the fix for it would be available \"soon\". Tesla has been selling this incomplete, hazardous tow package for a year and a half with the promised fix nowhere in sight.",

The staff rushed orientation (we are first-time EV owners) saying they were so busy that we could only get 15-30 minutes max for a complex vehicle. They told us calibration is normal and to reboot the Y if anything happens and showed us how. Once we drove off the lot the A/C went out and we got calibration prompts saying Pull Over. We pulled over less than 0.5 miles out and the A/C came on. Because of the bullying at the dealer we we afraid to go back and decided to go home. Again the calibration prompts came on and Pull Over. My wife was driving with my daughter and my in-law's and I was behind her in another car with our son. She suddenly started slowing down on the road because the vehicle would not let her accelerate. I pulled over to the side but she could not. I went to her and rebooted the Y, per Tesla's directions, and the car went dark and locked me and my in-law's inside in moving traffic (my wife had exited with my daughter). We had to call Gilbert police to direct traffic around us (had many angry drivers until Gilbert police came not understanding why a Y with a paper license tag was stopped in the road) and a tow truck for help. Two other drivers did stop to help too. I found the manual release but my in-law's could not. The tow truck driver had to climb (we had previouly rolled the windows down with the A/C issue) from the front seats to the back to get my in-law's out and paid $140.00 to have our new Y towed back to the dealer.

Also it will randomly slow down if traffic in the other lane is going slower than the speed limit. There is one thing my car hasn't done before that isn't disclosed in the manual. When driving past semis on the interstate the autopilot feature will cause the car to nearly drive on the road line opposite of the semi.

Please forward this email to the appropriate person if you can't help me, but copy me on any email forwarding. Recently, I just completed a long, 4 week driving trip to California and back to Durango, CO in my new Tesla Model Y during which I used FSD, which I purchased in September 2023. During this trip, about 5-6 times my 15\" screen showed a pair of RED HANDS and warned me to keep my hand on the steering wheel, EVEN THOUGH MY HANDS WERE ON THE WHEEL. On one occasion in UTAH, while on a 2 lane, newly paved section of road without striping, the RED HANDS warning displayed and FSD dropped out, but this time, it displayed that since I didn't have my hand on the wheel (BUT MY HANDS WERE ON THE WHEEL) that it reduced my limit of 5 warning by 1 to only 4 remaining warnings, before FSD would never again work on my model Y. Since my FSD is beta software, I consider these inappropriate RED HANDS to be a serious bug that needs to be fixed. I also want my Tesla model Y to have the full 5 appropriate warning limit restored to 5. I want someone from Tesla to look into this safety issue and contact me how Tesla is going to correct it and restore my warning limit to 5.

Over the course of owning the vehicle, I have experienced multiple issues with these systems that led to three parking accidents and safety concerns. On several occasions, the Tesla Vision system displayed a message indicating \"Tesla Vision will experience degraded performance.\" This message appeared consistently, signaling an ongoing issue with the system's capabilities. The degraded performance of Tesla Vision was particularly evident in its inability to accurately gauge distances and detect obstacles during parking maneuvers. The Parking Assist feature, which is crucial for safe and efficient parking, also exhibited significant flaws. The system failed to provide accurate distance measurements and warnings, which are essential for preventing collisions. This was especially problematic in tight parking spaces and while maneuvering near obstacles. Specific incidents of concern include: 1. A parking accident occurred when attempting to park in my garage. The Tesla Vision system failed to accurately detect the garage door, resulting in a collision while exiting the garage and attempting to turn the car. 2. Another incident involved a collision with a white column positioned against a gray wall, which the Tesla Vision system failed to recognize, leading to vehicle damage. These incidents highlight the unreliability of the Tesla Vision and Parking Assist systems in their current state. Prior to owning the Tesla Model Y, I drove a 2019 Acura MDX and had no parking accidents. The technicians at the Tesla dealership do not use the Park Assist because of this I have a video showing assist lines moving from stop to 16\" ... while parked.

However, while replacing the cover, they damaged the side door coverings. Again after lot of follow up they agreed to replace that part as well. So, we thought we are happy but later we had to face very scary situations with this faulty car. The steering car completed locked while driving and had to face very dangerous situation. We are fortunate that the traffic was low in the street road, and if it was in highways, then it could have been fatal. Earlier, when we are reversing the vehicle in the garage the vehicle didn't turn well enough and the driver side mirror was hit the garage siding, and earlier to that when we are turning the car to the neighborhood the tire got touched to side walkway and threading was damaged. We strongly believe these could be the result of the steering wheel on and off locking in second which we are not sure at that time. As model y is new to us, we are not sure how that drives but now understand the issues clearly.

I have observed, even when I mildly apply break the safety score is impacted. The second factor in safety score that seems unreasonable is driving after 10pm.

Automatic Emergency braking was applied with kids in back eat to school on an internal 35mph road in broad day light with a solid cement divider in left and no vehicle around anywhere. Everyone was hurt someway or other due to this phantom braking and would have been much worse on highway as there are many trucks on this side. Seems accelerator was also not working for few seconds. A software fliker is seen, seconds before this, in video. Not sure a hack, bug or intentional. Major safety issue, have video from dashcam. 2. The FSD is not ready, whatever Tesla says, it doesn\u2019t care about road condition, speed or other surroundings. Drives like aggressive kid who just learned driving & doesn\u2019t care about anyone or anything. Thats the reason have stopped using it. 3.The automatic lane departure assistance is very dangerous at the as it takes control of vehicle and tries to move away from lane as soon as you are around the border, without considering speed, other vehicles in side lanes, road condition or road hazards and due to this, several time it happened like tug of war, where other vehicles were too close like a truck in there lane left & right, hence was trying to be on edge of lane and this system was yanking to go away from line, causing shaking & was about to hit other vehicles. This may have caused accidents, had to turn this off as well. 4. The estimated range is so wrong and off my 70-100 miles and this could cause safety issues for family in night or cold getting stuck or anxiety that can cause emotional trauma and safety issues. 5. Other small stuff- Wiper turn on without rain or water, sentry mode don't work if charge is below 65 miles, which could be a security risk, fandom door open notification, bluetooth issue, car don't unlock, costly super charger etc. Sorry but had no other way.",

Tire pressure was per the recommendation from manufacturer as there was no deviation indication prior to the incident. After driving on same section of the road for at least two times no potholes were observed as the section of the I-90 around that area appears to be relatively recently laid. The tire was inspected at home after the incident and there was no FOD found in tire. As a first impression it appears to have failed at the tire wall. Expectation is that after failure the tire wall should be able to sustain the vehicle weight and operation of vehicle at least for a very short distance to pull over the car from the traffic on a highway for safety of driver/passengers and other vehicles on highway. In this case the consequence of incident could have been a very serious life threatening event. A detailed analysis of design specification and manufacturing process of tire including quality program and sustainability would make sense to verify if this is a design and/or manufacturing failure, to validate and re-evaluate the certification and prevent this type of issue. Also it is quite surprising that tires for this make of vehicle are not covered under warranty. It would also be important to find out idf similar incidents have happened but not reported.

While on the drive, I noticed that the screen was showing \u201ccalibration in progress\u201d. When I reached home at around 11:40 am. CST, Tesla showed a total of 12 miles on it, and as the garage door opened, the screen showed STOP as it said the calibration finished. As instructed, I stopped moving the vehicle on seeing HOLD/STOP while entering the garage from the driveway. Suddenly, the car jerked forward forcefully, as if a magnet had attracted it inside with the pedal going down. The car went into the garage and hit the garage wall, damaging the common garage wall and the other side being the master bathroom (by damaging the cabinets, big wall mirror(s), counter top etc), and also damaged the front bumper of the car. I was shocked and terrified for a while. So immediately rushed to the center again and reported the incident at Plano Service Center, who created a ticket on the same day. They said that this case would be sent to the engineering team for review. on Sep 10th, I got a reply from Service saying they have reviewed the Engineering study for the vehicle and the results displayed show that the vehicle operated as intended due to the use of the accelerator pedal at the time of the incident. Also reported to Auto insurance who came and assessed the damage to the bumper which also rattles or squeaks. The service for collision is scheduled for Dec 7th 2023 by Tesla Collision Dallas center.

I was also not hurt. - Not sure what malfunction happened , but the break in that instant of time was not acting as it should for few seconds. Yes, the car is available for inspection - My safety was at risk as the car was no behaving the way it should and I got scared as to what would happened next. Since there were no people in the other car, there was no risk. but if there were they probably would have got hurt. - I reported the issue to Tesla center. They said they will look but never heard back anything from them . - None of them has inspected the vehicle yet. - No warning signs were there. after it hit i could hear the beep",

Battery showed 59 % charge at that time. I managed to pull the car at intersection between highway and an exit before it totally stopped and became non-responsive in less than a minute. I started communicating via text with TESLA help line after attempting to reboot the screen which did not resolve the issue. While this communication was going on vehicle got badly rear ended by a passing car. We were all wearing seat belts and thanks to that we juts had mostly bruises but my son suffered agonizing psychological trauma and kept on crying incessantly for long. He also had an injury on right knee from a piece that shattered from the rear door which also got jammed after the impact. TESLA helpline said since accident has happened they will not be able to assist further, rest of the matter should be sorted out with my insurance. Some good Samaritans stopped the traffic for us and helped us leave the car immediately to the outer border of the exit road fearing that battery may catch fire as a result of impact burning everyone down. The car was later towed to a nearby facility arranged by Police and declared totaled by my insurance. It was some kind of electronic glitch which made car hung up like a computer but TESLA has so far not acknowledged that or offered any assistance. Of note on TESLA app when we press Roadside assistance, it leads to --> Drivability concern which displays first option as --> Shut down while driving. Its a serious issue needs thorough investigation. We all could have been dead if hit by a bigger vehicle and could have been multiple vehicle accident on a high speed highway.

    "summary": "I was turning right from a residential street onto a busy street during rush hour. I heard a sound, which made me think I might have run over something. Immediately following the sound, an alert showed up on the car\u2019s touch screen with the message: \u201cVehicle May not restart: Service required\u201d. The car was immediately inoperable - the car could not move and it could not shift into neutral to be pushed off the road. The 12V battery of the car continued to function for roughly 10 minutes after the car became stuck, which I knew because I was able to exit my vehicle normally, the touch screen remained illuminated and I was able to turn my hazards on. It did eventually die and I became locked out of the car at that point. I was in the middle of a busy intersection with no hazard lighting at that point and the car could not be moved, so I called emergency services and requested a police officer for traffic redirection while I waited around an hour and a half for a tow. Regarding the initial sound that I heard, I checked under the car as well as in the street around it, and there were no signs of debris or any visible evidence of damage to the undercarriage of the vehicle. I can only assume that the sound that I heard was whatever failure that had occurred internally in the car. At the time of this incident, the car was charged to around 85% of battery, was only a few weeks old, had never been in any type of collision, or required any service. Tesla has inspected the vehicle and identified the malfunction as a failure of the front and rear drive inverter. The situation that I was in was dangerous to myself and to the other drivers on the road with me. A sudden and complete stop on a busy road or in a location without cell coverage could be life threatening. The fact that there were no warning lamps, messages or any warning symptoms of the failure is extremely concerning and puts drivers and others on the road with them at a high risk.",

I have also used a fictitious USA address to satisfy your website requirements. My genuine contact details are available I understand that it is perfectly lawful for a non USA resident and a non owner to file a complaint. A Tesla Forum in Germany has a report from an owner detailing severe corrosion on the Ground terminal on his [XXX] car. This looks like galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals. I think a bad ground connection might be the reason for the spate of power steering complaints on this model and possibly also causing brake booster failure. Tesla has been blaming the steering rack and replacing it. I think it is highly unlikely that the steering rack is faulty and it is much more likely that bad ground connections are the cause. The 2023 Model Y has some changes from the 2022 model including the use of so large aluminum castings. I think this may increase the risk of Galvanic corrosion and be the cause of the alarming increase in failures. Fatal crashes into oncoming vehicles may have been caused by this.

The impact pushed that car into a second car and then that car pushed into a third car and the third car pushed into a fourth car. My car was totaled as well as three others. Fortunately, the impacted vehicles were unoccupied and there were no pedestrians. No warning beeps or emergency braking occurred. One of my passengers had minor injuries (3 fractured ribs). A police report was filed. Previously (3 or 4 weeks prior to crash) I had an incident in an above ground parking lot. I had pulled into a parking space, backed up to straighten out then was pulling forward towards the curb. I took my foot off the accelerator, but the car kept going very slowly instead of regeneratively braking as it had done before. I put my foot on the brake. It was unresponsive. I kept pressing and finally it engaged, and I was able to stop the car about five feet over the curb and into the grass.",

    "summary": "This is a report of a RECURRING problem commonly known as \"phantom braking.\" When I take long trips in this vehicle at legal freeway speeds and with the Adaptive Cruise Control and Auto Steer (lane keeping) functions engaged, the vehicle will occasionally reduce speed suddenly and violently (emergency braking) even if there are no vehicles ahead and no visible hazards whatsoever. This occurs without warning and for no reason when cruising on open, straight interstate highways. In a typical 5-8 hour driving day on long trips, this will occur 1-2 times daily. If other vehicles were to be following closely behind, this would certainly cause a serious rear end collision or pile up. The vehicle gives no advance warning and no alarms sound. The car just brakes suddenly and violently scaring the bejesus out of my spouse. I have learned to step hard on the accelerator the moment this occurs which will partially offset the severe braking action so that any vehicles behind do not need to brake suddenly. I do wonder what the heck any drivers behind think when they see the Tesla suddenly brake hard then accelerate immediately back to speed. I worries me too that some aggressive driver behind might think I am doing this intentionally and get into a road rage incident with me. People have been shot and killed for less. I don't understand why this has not yet been addressed seriously by Tesla or NHTSA. This is a SERIOUS and dangerous defect! Thank you.",

    "summary": "Concern: The \"Autopilot\" system in my 2023 Tesla Model Y AWD LR has shown diminished performance, particularly in adaptive cruise control, compared to the 2018 Model 3 RWD Long Range. Account: I aim to notify NHTSA about a concerning \"Autopilot\" behavior in my 2023 Model Y AWD LR. I am comparing this to the performance of my previous 2018 Model 3 RWD Long Range, driven under similar conditions. Incidents: Near Accidents: During commutes, my Model Y AWD LR frequently doesn't slow timely. In some cases, I've had to override Autopilot and brake abruptly to avoid collisions by risking letting the car either fail to brake fully or slam on the brakes so hard. The car's sudden deceleration at the last moment is concerning as it is not only a dangerous scenario for myself and my occupants, but also other drivers behind me, who might also crash. Conditions: These instances took place during daylight with a spotless vehicle, ensuring no camera obstructions. Settings: I set the distance threshold between levels 4 and 5 and ensured the speed was no more than 10 mph above the speed limit. Lane Keeping: The lane-keeping function is efficient. However, adaptive cruise control's reliability is questionable. Sensor Absence: The 2023 Model Y lacks radar and USS (ultrasonic sensors). This could be affecting the performance drop I've noticed. Accidents: Due to these issues, I've narrowly missed three accidents just this week alone, endangering my safety and others. Conclusion & Request: While Autopilot should enhance safety, my experience with the 2023 Model Y AWD LR suggests otherwise. This unexpected performance dip, especially with supposed hardware upgrades, is alarming. I urge NHTSA to investigate this issue swiftly. Given the popularity of this model, many drivers could be at risk.",

The steering wheel has been locking up from time to time; and the steering of the vehicle sometimes feels unwieldy, uncontrollable, and simply undrivable. The issue is very dangerous. I Googled the issue and came across Reddit posts and other Tesla forums where other Tesla drivers have reported the same issue. There are also YouTube videos that discuss the same issue. This seems to be a common enough problem that warrants a total recall. The Tesla service agent acknowledged that the problem seems routine and pervasive, but downplayed the issue.

    "summary": "I experienced multiple dangerous phantom braking instances on Eastbound I10 between Van Horn and Ozona, Texas when the TACC system was in use. The car is on firmware 2023.20.9. There were no obstructions in the road and no traffic in front of the vehicle when the car suddenly braked going from 80mph to 50mph in a second before I could take control and accelerate. In two instances, cars were behind me creating a dangerous situation both in terms of an unexpected slow down on a barren stretch of interstate and possible road rage if motorists believed I was brake checking. There were no warning messages on the screen and no audible warning sounds. This is a consistent problem with this vehicle and seems to happen regularly on desert interstates or other highways where there are not many trees on bright sunny days. These events seem to happen on stretches of highway in which there may be a loss of cell signal so I wonder if that is a contributing factor. Regardless, Tesla needs to fix this issue as it is unsafe.",

It appears to me that the vehicle cameras are occasionally mistaking these dark patches as an obstacle. Presumably lidar sensors would not react because the radar would not bounce back off anything, but I believe my car does not have lidar sensors. In each case there was an approximate 10 to 15 mph reduction in speed and then the vehicle quickly recovered. Fortunately, no other vehicle was tailgating me at the time but if one had been, I believe there is a realistic risk of being rear ended.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 To whom it may concern I was driving in a 2023 Model Y around 7:30 in the evening at less than 30mph. There was light rain in the area. As I was driving down a street in the metro Boston area, I noticed the car ahead of me had slowed and was stopping behind another car at a crosswalk. I had taken my foot off the accelerator and noticed that the car did not slow down at all and the regenerative braking did not function properly. Even as I attempted to brake, it seemed like the car would not stop in time. To avoid hitting the car in front of me, in a split second decision I swerved to the left so that I would avoid hitting any other car. My Tesla Model Y went over the median and struck a crossing light pole before coming to a stop. During the seconds leading up to this no preventative warning sounds came from the cars safety systems (eg.collision alert warning, emergency braking) although on most other days it often beeped even when there was nothing directly in front me. Thankfully I did not hit anyone else and we were not injured. However, this was a shocking and highly disconcerting event and could have been worse had the car been traveling at a higher rate of speed or if I had been on a different street without an option to swerve. A preliminary verbal report from Tesla in a phone call stated that \"all systems were working as intended\". I have made a formal request for driver and video data for that incident from Tesla and am still waiting to receive it. As of now, my Tesla has been considered totaled and a complete write off. It is only 2.5 months old. Having driven hundreds of thousands of miles in various cars over decades, I have never experienced anything like this. Why there was unintended acceleration in such a situation is extremely confusing and has greatly impacted my faith in Tesla at the moment. 1 Affected Product 1 Associated Document",

So I was very comfortable in driving the tesla model y. Date of incidents - 07/07/2023. At Tinton Falls NJ. I was trying to take a K turn on a flat road at around 9:30 a.m. I put the car in Reverse. When I pressed the accelerator pedal the car went forward and hit an Electric Pole. I then pressed the brake pedal . Made sure the car is on Reverse Gear . On leaving the break pedal the car was automatically moving forward towards the pole. This should never had happen. I put the car in Park mode and waited for 5-10 mins approx. Then after some time when I put the reverse gear and left the brake pedal the car didnt move and on pressing acceleration it reversed. I parked my car at the site where I had my work. Police were called and they gave me a ticket. I had a sprain in my neck. Later by 2 pm I drove with the same car Home at Edison NJ. (1 hr drive) I called Tesla Customer Service and they advised me to take the car to Springfield NJ dealership as it could be a software glitch. I decided to drive the tesla with my family in other car to the dealership incase they decide to keep the car. I was about to enter into Fadem Rd when lifted my feet off the acceleration pedal to slow down. The car all off sudden accelerated with no steering control. I noticed lots of car on the street and a lady exiting out of near by Staples Drive Way. I grabbed the steering and rotated it all the way to the right to avoid any of them, hit a pole on the passenger side , pressing the brakes really hard and hitting a bush. The car stopped, no air bags deployed , no warning signs nothing. I was in a shock and pain . EMTs took me to ER , I had severe muscle sprain and still recovering.",

    "summary": "Tesla's Autopilot feature regularly experiences \"phantom braking\". A typical scenario is while traveling on an interstate highway in Idaho, Oregon or Washington state at the speed limit (70 to 80 MPH), the car will suddenly and violently decelerate. The severity can vary between annoying to so extreme that the passenger is thrown forward hard enough to engage the retention mechanism in the seat belt. This happens under seemingly perfect conditions-- mid-day, clear skies, clear lane markings, smooth pavement in good condition, straight section of road. The deceleration can be overridden by pressing the accelerator or disengaging autopilot but by that time the risk of being rear-ended by anyone traveling close behind is very high. For this reason I've been using the feature less and less which leaves me without any form of basic cruise control. In two different trips of around 500 miles, phantom braking has occurred between 10 and 20 times each. In two different service requests, Tesla has confirmed that my car, including the vision system, is operating within normal specifications. Beyond that they're unwilling to engage in any form of diagnosis or investigation. There are two fundamental problems here: 1) Tesla's Autopilot feature in unreliable and dangerous 2) The car I purchased was advertised to have Cruise Control, implemented by Tesla with their Autopilot feature. Because of 1), it effectively has no Cruise Control.",

This was on a 2-lane road in the Arizona \u201ccountryside.\u201d It was between 6:20am and 7:15am on Saturday, May 13th. The motorhome following me had to make a split-second decision to either crash into the rear of my car, or swing out left into the oncoming lane. He chose the latter. Fortunately, there was no oncoming traffic or it surely would have been a fatal, head-on accident between the motorhome and a car traveling in the opposite direction in the oncoming lane. The motorhome then continued to pass me and no accident resulted. In the other 4 times that the brakes suddenly applied, there was no one close enough behind me where they could not have slowed down to avoid an accident. Obviously, this was very disturbing to me. I finally realized that the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) feature was set to \u201con\u201d (by default). I then turned it off. No further incidents occurred after this. At this point, I will not travel on a busy freeway with the AEB feature activated\u2026\u2026it is simply too dangerous. If this issue happens on a busy freeway, the likelihood of someone crashing into the rear of my car is fairly high.",

First and foremost, the car was misrepresented regarding its safety features and its suitability for passengers riding in the back. Since my purchase, I have noticed significant safety concerns for individuals seated in the back of the vehicle. The lack of proper safety restraints, along with inadequate seat belt functionality, poses a serious risk to the well-being of those riding in the rear seats. I find it deeply troubling that these critical safety aspects were not made known to me prior to the purchase. Moreover, my discontent is further compounded by the fact that, merely two months after my purchase, I discovered that the prices for the same make and model of the car were drastically reduced. This revelation indicates that I paid an inflated price for the vehicle, which is both unfair and unjustifiable. I believe it is only reasonable that I be compensated for this disparity, as it implies a breach of trust and fair business practices.

A car immediately behind me (about 2 car lengths).. The sun was at the roughly 10 o-clock position (Horizontal plane, 12 o'clock being directly forward/North), and at about 10 o'clock vertically (12 o'clock being directly up, West at 9 o'clock, East at 3 o'clock, centered on my position). Full Self Driving beta visualization was enabled. The vehicle was not in AutoSteer or Full Self Driving mode - but it was in Traffic-Aware Cruise Control mode. My car braked hard and suddenly, causing the car behind me to brake. On the FSD display, a red vehicle was rendered on top of my location (driver position of this \"ghost\" vehicle would have been ~2 feet in front of where I was sitting). This phantom car appears to have been caused by lens flare from the sun. This sequence of events repeated itself four or five times over the next few minutes, with the ghost car appearing, the car trying to brake, and then disappearing. My safety was put at risk due to hard and unexpected braking under conditions where there was no reasonable expectation that I would need to perform an emergency stop. The risk was from the vehicle behind me having to unexpectedly stop; without an attentive drive this would have caused a collision. The vehicle has not been examined by any dealer or service center, and appears to be a software problem that occurs under specific lighting conditions.",

Tried turning off the forward collision avoidance option and the events still happen. Have kept the windshield over the front camera areas clean. It has happened typically during sunny days as we have not usually used the cruise control in the rain. When these events happen there is typical rapid slowing of the vehicle by 20-30 mph within a few seconds. If a car was following close behind us, there would be a high chance of collision. There have been no warning messages or any signs that the vehicle is otherwise malfunctioning. When we contacted Tesla technical assistance, they emailed us a copy of the part of the car manual that says the feature might not function in bad weather, if the camera is not clean, in construction zones, etc. none of which describe the circumstances of when this malfunction happens in the car in broad daylight. They also said whenever it happens to send a bug report which the technicians will look at. They also said it might be fixed with the next update, which of course, it wasn't. Finally, in the same batch of emails, they sent email that said we could report our issue to NHTSA which without any other resolution method to the problem, is why I am reporting it here. It seems as if there are many Tesla owners who are reporting this problem online. It may have been less of a problem before Tesla removed the radar feature in the last year and depended solely on their front cameras to make automatic braking decisions for the car. Whatever is happening, it isn't working and makes driving with cruise control scary and dangerous. Thank you for listening. Please help.",

    "summary": "Incidents of phantom braking: We took our brand new Tesla model Y on a road-trip from Saint Helena CA to Scottsdale AZ and back. We had several incidents of the car slamming on the brakes while in cruise control due to mistakes in recognizing an actual reason to brake. May 11, in Arizona on highway 60, single lane road, we were in the right lane heading east when a large white pickup approached in the left lane. Our car mistook the approaching vehicle as a potential collision and slammed the brakes. This occurred a second time with another approaching vehicle at which point we ceased using cruise control. May 17 return trip on highway 10 in the morning, as I was driving with cruise control on, two lane highway, I approached a swale in the road with a change in pavement color. Gray concrete color contrasted with the blacktop patches in the upslope of the swale and the car slammed on the brakes. Same day, same highway, I was in the left lane having passed a slower vehicle. There were two cars behind me, waiting to pass. I put on the right turn signal and began to move into the right lane. There were a series of white jersey barriers on either side of the road. The car mistook these as a potential collision, slammed on the brakes and pushed me back toward the left lane. I applied the accelerator and forced it back into the right lane, avoiding a collision with the cars behind me. May 18 driving north on highway 5, multi lane highway and as my wife was driving and crested a hill there was a wire hanging across the road. In the center of the wire was a camera or some other device. While the wire was at least 6 feet over us, the car mistook it for an obstruction and slammed on the brakes.",

All the issues that I have reported at that time either all of them are still open or while fixing any of those issues it caused even more issues in my car. As of now I have given my car 5-6 times to them for service so they may fix them but still all those issues either still exists or not fixed well. I am fed up giving my new car back to them for servicing and booking appointments & visiting them. Initially one of their employee gave me a confirmation that he is working with Tesla to buy back my car but then after 30 days I got to understand that Tesla employee is no more working with Tesla and have been fooling around me. I am not sure what kind of customer service, assurance does Tesla provides to its customer and how they working towards resolving those issues. I have paid $68000 to buy this car- and I feel like I am driving a car which got lot of design issues and I feel like I paid for new car and I am driving a 2nd hand car. It so much noise and rattle in my car and that also started to come after they tried to fix issues in my car. So, I am no more interested to get the issues fixed in a factory fitted car rather should have a new car or should get a full refund of the car. I am attaching a PDF of email thread that is going on from last 2-3 months with Tesla service employee and still they just want me to keep coming and giving my car to them. I don't have any more trust on them. Attach PDF shows all the issues and how they are just wanting me to spend time and keep explaining the same issues to them. All the issues details can also be referred from the email attached. Also from the email you may see- I was supposed to get one of issue fixed today but they have pushed again my appointment again after 10 days and not addressing my email.

Fortunately, the parking lot of empty with no passenger or vehicle to run into. I pressed the brake and the car came into a complete stop. I can only imagine what could have happened if the parking lot was not empty. I parked my car and went for my appointment. After my appointment and I drove the same car home with no issues, I am curious to understand what has happened so I started researching online whether this is a one of issue or there are others who have had similar experience. I found that there are cases describing something similar to what I had experience but the investigation blamed it on user misuse or misapplication of acceleration. I STRONGLY believe that there is more to this issue than what your previous investigation has unravelled and my concern is more about the public safety danger that this represents. What could have happened if there are people at the parking? What if this had happened in a public square?

But, at my following first long distance trip I noticed the same exact problem persisting. I contacted the same Tesla Sterling Service Center. Following took place: 1. At my validation drive the technician told me he can see the problem 2. After we returned to the service center, the technician noted \"there is no problem\" and Tesla Sterling service center marked my appointment as \"fixed, no problem\". 3. I contacted the service center and expressed my surprise, explained what I heard from the technician. 4. They did do further investigation and reported a bent wheel. 5. The service center didn't fix the problem by replacing the wheel, they put the blame on me by saying \"I must have gone into a pothole\" by creating a good deal of damaging pressure, hence a bent wheel. 6. I asked for pictures of the wheel and the tire, and I am attaching them to this msg. It is clear from these pictures there is no external damage to the tire or the wheel, so it must be the case that Tesla must have put faulty wheels on a brand new car and shipped it to me this way.Tesla Sterling service center didn't replace the bent wheel, even though they kept the car in the service center for 6 days, indicating the wheel is not under warranty. I spoke to friends and family, I heard similar stories. I strongly believe that Tesla ships new cars with faulty wheels and Tesla needs to fix the problem. A bent wheel, which causing a mirror tho shake is a safety problem, a big one.",

Auto wipers in many cases can be less safe than manual as as soon as they come on the driver is scrambling to fumble with the touchscreen to get them off before they decrease visibility.",

These occurrences happened 3 to 5 times each day while I was either using adaptive cruise control or autopilot features on my vehicle. At times this occurred soon after passing another vehicle or semi truck, but sometimes it happened without any other vehicles in sight of my vehicle. The phantom braking occurred without warning and caused a rapid deceleration of my vehicle, at times risking an accident due to the vehicle behind me having to abruptly brake even though there was no indication of any sort of road hazard to alert them of a need to brake. Due to this random, unwarranted braking risk I was forced to keep my foot hovering over the accelerator so that when it occurred I could quickly press the accelerator to override the phantom braking. I tried to monitor the road conditions when the phantom braking would occur and the only seeming commonality may have been when it was a bright and sunny day with slight natural undulations in the roadway, but I cannot be absolute sure of those observed conditions being causal or just coincidental to the events. What does seem to be consistent was I did not seem to experience phantom braking during overcast conditions.",

The first instance happened as I pulled out from a stop sign to take an unprotected left onto a street. In the middle of the intersection, the car shuddered to a stop violently and a lot of warnings and alerts came up on screen. Cars moving both directions had to suddenly stop to not hit my car dead in the intersection. The gear stalk inputs to put the car in drive or reverse and allow function of the vehicle did not work. I pushed the park button on the right stalk and then moved it into drive, which it allowed. I was then able to limp the car out of the intersection (with power vastly reduced and speed reduced) and await a tow. The second instance I had pulled into a parking lot at around the same speed (~15 mph) in which the car again shuddered violently to a stop with no ability to override. Traffic behind me had to brake as to not hit my vehicle which stopped in the middle of the lot. Again the car was inoperable until this time locking and unlocking the car from outside of it and reentering to limp it to a parking spot for tow. Safety of myself and others were put severely at risk suddenly and without warning from the car stopping itself. If this were to happen in other, less fortunate scenarios, risk to human lives is great. Problem has been confirmed by Tesla service center, but not reproduced while in their possession.

On Friday January 27th at approximately 4:30pm we were driving on RT773 Riverside Parkway in the right hand lane and the steering wheel came totally out of the column with wires and electronic exposed. I was able to slow the car down and the car went up on the curb. I kept trying to put the steering wheel back in the column and somehow managed to get it in enough to drive home which was 5 miles away. All of the electronics did not work. Tesla came and towed the car the same evening. There was no working warning. Tesla towed the car and the next day on Saturday said the bolt to the steering column was loose and became dislodged.",

The original USS Park Assist feature would detect this but the current Vision feature would not if the object or child is closer than 3 feet. It is irresponsible for a car manufacturer to eliminate a safety feature without providing a similar function as a substitute immediately.

We had previously experienced this \"phantom braking\" during a roadtrip a few weeks ago. At that time, we reported the problem to our Tesla dealer and they sent a technician to our house on Feb 3, 2023. The technician told us that we were experiencing this phantom braking and all of the newer Tesla's had this problem.

He further told me that there have been no reports of any accidents, injuries or deaths as a result of this phantom braking problem. That was reassuring at the time.

I am now forced to manually remember to DISABLE the dangerous Emergency Braking feature with my brand new car. I have owned cars with cruise control for decades - I am 62 tears old. I have never had an accident on the highway. Never. This is because I keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

However, when I am on the highway in heavy traffic and the car brakes for no reason whatsoever, the chance of having a car ram into me from from behind is a serious danger to myself and my family.

Then we went out to a nearby store. I was the driver(>20 yrs experience). When we stopped on Smithtown Bypass/Moriche by the red light, during the waiting, the car suddenly took off, with an unbelievable speed. THANK GOD!! I don\u2019t know what happened, but I was extremely calm at that moment. I heard my husband screaming and I knew both of us know we are going to directly hit the cars that drove from the left. To avoid such definite impact, I had no choice but quickly made a very aggressive left turn and stopped on the road of Moriche. To be safe, I drove the car back to Tesla around 2pm. The guy said it could be my mistake of accidentally hitting a button of cruise control. I truly doubted it. Is there a button can be unintentionally hit without warning? I asked him to look into the report. I told him I was fully stopped and waiting on the red light. My foot was completely off the pedal. My hands were on the wheel. My eyes were on the road rather than on the touch screen for any information displayed. No warning signs at all. I felt I might have heard some noise while the car shooting out but I am not sure. Even though this serious incident was reported right away and our car was parked in front of the service door, we were scheduled to get a service check on 23rd. And then we were informed by an email that the service check has been rescheduled to January 30th. I believe this incident must be reported and be awarded by other Tesla drivers as well. While Tesla bragging how safe their cars are, my personal experience told me a totally different story. Please investigate this incident ASAP because I think Tesla didn\u2019t take it seriously. I wish there is a traffic footage can be obtained. I can\u2019t imagine how many families would be destroyed if the accident happened! Praise the LORD for His mercy!!",

I\u2019ve called multiple windshield repair companies for many months and non of them carry the windshield or have the tools needed to recalibrate the ADAS.

All parts were provided at no cost. However, I was required to pay out of pocket for all labor related to this mandatory free recall: $1019.28. Two other issues were looked at as part of my visit to EV Works. They inspected and waterproofed electrical connectors in the front passenger side bumper. Fisker failed to adequately protect these as part of the vehicle assembly and they are known to get water intrusion and fail. This cost out of pocket $71.60. Part of why EV Works was looking at the electrical connections is because I have an ADAS Radar Fault warning. They determined this is caused by failure of both front mid range radar components. which leaves the vehicle with no Blind Spot Monitoring. I have heard of several other owners online reporting a similar issue with their cars. I expect this is due to low quality parts used in assembly and that more cars will start to get this warning and lose the ADAS feature. EV Works quoted this replacement as $980.97 but I have not completed the repair yet. This should have been covered by Fisker warranty.",

    "summary": "I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding the ongoing issues that are being seen with the NHTSA recall campaign numbers 24V865000 and 24V623000. The experience I had with my Fisker vehicle following the 2.2 Over-the-Air (OTA) update attempt left my vehicle un-driveable from Jun 15 2024 through Oct 26 2024. This had left me in an inconvenient and frustrating situation. As a result, I had to incur additional expenses to have the necessary safety updates completed to restore my vehicle's functionality. This is far from the experience that I expected when signing up for a free mandated safety recall. While my vehicle was functioning fine after this manual update, on April 17th 2025 the OTA team pushed a software update 2.2.2 which seems to have regressed my car to some older version which has made it unstable again. It is draining battery much faster than before and my passenger side door handle won't extend anymore. This is going to require me to get these fixed at an additional cost. Moreover, I've noticed a concerning trend regarding the frequency of issues reported by fellow owners after OTA updates.I urge you to address these issues promptly, putting more vehicles in danger of becoming un-driveable because of the safety recall process being flawed may not be helpful in this current process. Additionally, I would appreciate any assistance you can offer in resolving my current situation and compensating for the expenses incurred due to this inconvenience.

Stopping in the heavy traffic, as the warnings told us is a safety hazard! This happened twice when driving on [XXX] in Costa Mesa, CA at [XXX] in February and March 2025. At that time, we are basically driving into the bright sunlight. Traffic was heavy with lots of stop and go between 0 mph and 30 mph. I kept at least 3-5 car distances, yet the ADAS alerts kept going off for several minutes. 2. After the latest 2.2 upgrade, our real-world range dropped from 340 miles to 280 miles. The car is supposed to be rated for 360 miles. I've had much better range before the 2.2 upgrade driving from San Diego to Los Angeles, as well as from San Diego to Central California Coast. The massive reduction in range is partly a safety hazard, as we can get stranded if we don't plan ahead to account for this bug. The bug is believed to be programming to the rear drive motor. Excess current to the motor can lead to overheating and potentially cause a fire, which is another safety hazard.

    "summary": "Description of Incident(s) On March 5, 2025, I discovered that my 2023 Fisker Ocean had undergone an unauthorized over-the-air (OTA) software update to version 2.2.2 without my knowledge or consent. I received no prior notification from Fisker or American Leasing, the current entity managing Fisker vehicles following the company\u2019s bankruptcy in 2024. Additionally, I have no access to the vehicle\u2019s cloud system or update logs to understand what changes were implemented, leaving me unable to assess the scope or purpose of the update. Following this update, I experienced two significant safety-related issues with my vehicle, detailed below. Driver\u2019s Door Handle Overheating After the 2.2.2 update, the driver\u2019s side door handle began exhibiting extreme overheating, reaching temperatures exceeding 130\u00b0F as measured with a non-contact infrared thermometer. This poses a serious burn hazard and makes the handle unsafe to touch for entry or exit. The issue appears to be electrical in nature, potentially related to a malfunction in the door handle actuator or power management system altered by the software update. The handle remains excessively hot even when the vehicle is powered off, suggesting a persistent fault. This defect compromises safe access to the vehicle and presents a risk of injury. Rearview Mirror Fan Constantly Running Since the update, the fan associated with the vehicle\u2019s digital rearview mirror now runs continuously, regardless of whether the mirror is in use or the vehicle\u2019s thermal conditions warrant cooling. This creates unnecessary noise, potential wear on the fan component, and a possible drain on the vehicle\u2019s battery. While the digital mirror functionality remains operational, the constant fan operation suggests a software glitch affecting thermal regulation or sensor feedback loops, likely introduced by the 2.2.2 update. This issue, while not immediately hazardous, indicates broader concerns with the stability of the vehicle\u2019s software systems post-",

I left the car alone for 3 days, to be sure that there was plenty of time for the update to be pushed. When I went to drive the car on [XXX], the car would not drive. It showed to be in \"N\" (neutral), would not shift to park or drive, every warning light possible was lit on the dash, and the \"pedestrian warning\" hum was sounding. Even exiting the vehicle and locking it did not turn off the infotainment center. I was unable to move or drive the vehicle in this state, and there are NO mechanics in Arizona with a FAST tool, to diagnose or fix the car. I had a former Fisker Master Technician come change the 12V battery (which cost $305.40 for the battery, and $150 for the install), but this did not reverse the above situation. Because it was \"bricked\", I couldn't even charge the HV battery to keep the 12V charged, so I had to hook up a 15A maintainer to the 12V, so that the car wouldn't drain the brand new 12V. The tech also tried disconnecting the HV battery, and reconnecting it, in hopes that it would reset, but it didn't. With no FAST tools available in my state, I ultimately had to sell the vehicle at a loss of about $70,000. When the new owner tried to have it towed, the front wheels were locked, despite the car showing it was in \"N\" (neutral), and it had to be dragged out of the garage, and then died (12V, now no longer on a maintainer) in the street, waiting for a tow truck that could haul it with the locked front wheels. I was never able to drive it after the attempted 2.2 update, so never got the recall work completed. I was also never able to get the water pump recall done, either.",

In the end, I had the car towed back to my home, so at least I could charge the high voltage battery and put the 12v battery on a tender (as required). From this first incident of \"black screens on startup\" on [XXX], each day afterward, I would test the car to see if it would start up correctly -- on some days it would start up with all 3 displays booting up into a functional state, on other days, I would again experience the \"black screens at startup\" and would be unable to drive the car. Only the Carplay screen I added to the car would be illuminated (shown in photo attached). I contacted Fisker-trained technicians who diagnosed the ICC as having been compromised during the OTA update. I found a salvaged ICC from another Ocean on eBay, purchased it, then paid to have it installed into my car and programmed to match it to my VIN number.

The mileage remaining calculation also suddenly dropped, causing concern I would not make it home from work safely.

The driver door out side handle did not automatically pop out to allow me to exit. I tried locking and unlocking the door internally and also tried with the car on and in park. On one occasion the window was stuck closed, probably because of icing. I ended up crawling over to the passenger side to get out. On the other occasions the door handle was popped out but I had to open the window and open the door using the outside handle. Frequently, the driver door handle won't go back in until after I have been driving for a few minutes. This seems to be the only handle with the issue of \"sticking\" either popped in or popped out. Occasionally when I lock it using the key fob, all the handles go in except the driver side. When I give it a little push from the outside it will go back in. At 2600 miles the NFC reader in the door handle stopped working. It is my understanding that the door handle recall was already performed on this vehicle. It is my belief that the vehicle is not better off after the recall. And that the $100 being offered to perform a door handle recall is far below the real world cost of such a service. Not to mention most techs can't get in and out of the door without leaving some damage to the panels or clips. I believe the recall on this vehicle for the door handles should not be considered completed. Or it should be reopened. There is also no emergency release strap anywhere in the vehicle for a door or window. Similar to the trunk manual pull from the inside. Please help us get this fixed. The ADAS warnings and chimes blinking lights etc are distracting as they are mainly warning for things we don't have working. Also the drivers screen flashes red to blue when changing fram accel to decel. Very distracting at night. Thank you.",

    "summary": "Prior to a recall-mandated update of the vehicle's operating system, I received numerous (daily) ADAS warning lights and sounds. Regen braking often (2-3 times per week) jerked the car abruptly. Additionally, the ADAS lane-keeping process was jerky. The vehicle was evaluated by an over-the-air (OTA) team and determined to be ready for an OTA update, which occurred from 11/11/ to 11/12/2024. This update was managed by an OTA team that was mandated and funded by these NHTSA recalls: 24V865000 (Regen Braking OTA-2.2), 24V405000 (Warning Lights OTA-2.1), and 24V404000 (MCU/VCU Loss of Power OTA-2.1). The OTA update only partially loaded, with the vehicle was at OS 2.2 (2/3) and inoperable for 2 months, from 11/12/2024 through 01/12/2025. I made numerous attempts for support during this time, with communication via the Fisker Owners Association but no information from the OTA team. After I replaced the 12V battery, two recharges, and a remote tech support, the vehicle's electrical system was again available to receive an additional OTA update yet not operable. With limited notice, the vehicle received some of the missing components of OS 2.2 on 01/23/2025, at which point the vehicle was operational again. Though at this time the key fob only connects as an NFC device, with the potential risk of the key losing security connections while driving (and thus turning off, mid-drive). This has not occurred but a technician has noted this risk and I now \"velcro\" the key to the NFC port while driving. I have yet to receive two additional recall repairs: 24V499000 (Water pump), 24V466000 (Door Handles). I have an appointment with a former Fisker technician who has stated that I will need to pay him directly for the service time for replacing the water pump, and then seek reimbursement from the managers of the mandatory recall.",

    "summary": "I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding the ongoing issues that are being seen with the NHTSA recall campaign numbers 24V865000 and 24V623000. The experience I had with my Fisker vehicle following the 2.2 Over-the-Air (OTA) update attempt left my vehicle undrivable. This is leaving me in an inconvenient and frustrating situation. As a result, I will have to incur additional expenses to have the necessary safety updates completed to restore my vehicle's functionality. This is far from the experience that I expected when signing up for a free mandated safety recall. I understand that a significant percentage of vehicles (approximately 2%-5%) have become undrivable--like mine--following these updates. This situation is alarming and raises concerns about the reliability of the updates being delivered. According to owner surveys, it appears that complete updates\u2014which include all necessary corrections\u2014have been accomplished in less than 30% of cases. Furthermore, I was surprised to learn that only about 10% of the fleet (approximately 300 vehicles) had been updated after several weeks of attempts, despite over 800 VINs submitted for this process. This statistic raises questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of the OTA process. Lastly, I am deeply concerned about the limited number of service personnel available in the U.S., with only around 20 individuals servicing the entire country and merely 5 traveling nationwide to assist customers with undriveable vehicles. This scarcity is unacceptable and leads to extended wait times for necessary repairs and updates. I urge you to address these issues promptly, putting more vehicles in danger of becoming undrivable because of the safety recall process being flawed. It is imperative that this process is reviewed and the underlying safety concerns that have left many of us feeling unsupported and frustrated are resolved in a manner that will be free of cost and successful to the majority of owners. Thank you!",

I am writing to formally express my concerns regarding the OTA (Over-the-Air) update process for my vehicle. The current OTA process, lasting 48 hours, is simply not feasible for those of us who rely on our vehicles for daily activities. The inability to use my vehicle during this window forced me to pay out of pocket for alternative transportation, which is both inconvenient and financially burdensome. Additionally, it has come to my attention that there have been numerous reports from fellow owners indicating that a significant percentage of vehicles (approximately 2%-5%) have become undrivable following these updates. This situation is alarming and raises concerns about the reliability of the updates being delivered. Moreover, the lengthy windows of 48 hours for updates, coupled with the expectation of partial updates requiring additional time, have left many of us in a state of uncertainty regarding the functionality of our vehicles and forced to pay out of pocket for a mandatory free recall. 24V499000 - Water Pump failure.

    "summary": "This is regarding recall campaigns 24V466000 and 24V499000. Three problems: 1. The nearest service center that performs recall work is over 150 miles and 2.5 hours of travel time from my home. I have concerns that the failure cited for 24V499000 could occur during the the trip there, particularly in colder weather, leaving me stranded on the side of the road, and for that reason have put off the trip until it's warmer. Of course regardless of whether I wait for warm weather or not, continuing to drive my vehicle presents a safety risk for myself and others. The only other option I have is to for a mobile technician who comes to my home, but given the small number of such techs covering the entire country, that visit would be more than 2 months away and technician travel costs are not covered by the recall reimbursement amount that is being offered. 2. If I were to make the trip that's 2.5 hours, that repair shop has been unable to acquire the tools and parts to complete recall 24V466000. 3. There is as yet no means of requesting reimbursement for the cost of having recall repairs performed. As a result service organizations and mobile technicians are unwilling to do the work for free. As I understand it all costs of having a recall are to be borne by the auto manufacturer, in this case the trustee designated by the bankruptcy court. Clearly that is not happening. This situation is unacceptable and I would ask that your agency take all steps possible to see to it that owners such as myself can have these recalls addressed with a minimum of inconvenience and zero cost.",
