After car released to owner without addt'l testing, owner tested reverse automatic braking system. The system worked as expected - the car braked when it detected a close object in its field, it omitted the correct audible warning sounds and visual lights, and continued to perform when the driver depressed the braking system. Additionally, due to the newness of the car, the driver is extremely confident that no objects were around - the driver had been parking far from other vehicles to avoid dings. This \"computer glitch\" is potentially fatal as the car came to a sudden, complete stop while in motion and was unresponsive in any gear, even after brakes were applied and released.

    "summary": "I am filing a formal complaint regarding the safety systems on my 2025 Honda CR-V EX-L, particularly the overly aggressive Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) and intrusive Lane Keep Assist. While driving my children to school, my CR-V violently slammed the brakes because a scooter was creeping toward an intersection \u2014 clearly not entering traffic. The rider and I made eye contact, fully aware of each other, and there was an open left lane for evasive action if needed (it wasn't). Despite my clear judgment, the CMBS intervened, causing a violent deceleration that launched objects inside the vehicle, scared everyone, and increased the risk of a rear-end collision. I am shocked that Honda eliminated the hardware button to quickly disable CMBS. Now drivers must perform a multi-step procedure every time the vehicle starts \u2014 an unreasonable and unsafe burden. I previously owned a 2014 Accord and was a loyal, satisfied customer. I love nearly everything else about the CR-V, but these flawed \"safety\" systems are a potential deal-breaker. Sudden deceleration can cause concussions and greatly increase the chance of secondary accidents. Lane Keep Assist has created additional dangers. When I move slightly within my lane to create space from a semi-truck, the system unnecessarily corrects my steering. This is distracting and unsafe. Good drivers adjust dynamically, but these systems undermine good judgment rather than enhancing safety. Technology that overrides competent drivers is reckless, not \"intelligent.\" I request two changes: (1) Reinstate a hardware button to easily disable automatic emergency braking, and (2) Allow CMBS and Lane Keep Assist settings to persist across drives. Honda must redesign these systems with real-world driving in mind. Features that destroy driver trust are dangerous, not protective. I am deeply disappointed, frustrated, and have lost trust in my CR-V \u2014 a serious failure for a brand I once admired.",

I was driving with my 2025 Honda CRV and I noticed that the lane keep assist was having the ping pong affect when I first picked it up but I didn't really think too much about it. I assume my vehicle just needed some drive time since it was brand new and it was the first time it was on the highway. I noticed that this function was also causing the wheel to be very stiff. I know this system is a driving assistant and is not meant to take away from actual driving and paying attention to the road. But this week the system made an over correction and caused my vehicle turn into a guardrail on the highway. The road was straight, the day was clear and the lines on the lanes were very visible. There shouldn't have been an issue. I was pulled into the guardrail on the driver's side. I was with my girlfriend, her [XXX] son and my friend at the time. Everyone was a bit shaken up, I never had that happen before. It was primarily cosmetic damage to the vehicle and no other vehicles or property was damaged. I wasn't aware there was a steering recall on this vehicle until after the incident, and the recall was posted during the time I was finalizing the paperwork with my dealership for purchasing this vehicle. I haven't taken it to a dealership since getting the vehicle because they prepared everything prior to delivery or picking it up from the port in my case. I have filed a claim with my insurance company and hopefully the vehicle can be inspected for steering issues, to include the lane keep assist. I didn't get any warnings from the vehicle during the incident and I did notice that the steering is overly controlled by the adaptive cruise control when I try to make a turn in my own lane.

I stated that I am fearful for my and my family's safety if I drive the car. He stated that he was told by America Honda Motor Co , \"It is safe to drive the vehicle and that there is no danger of the steering seizing up to cause an accident\". He went on to say if I have any issues with the steering to call for an appt, drive it in and they will assess the car to determine if it is related to the recall and then they will contact Honda and see if they can expedite the part.

    "summary": "We were driving on a two lane highway from Jamestown Ca to Oakdale Ca, there were no vehicles in front of us, it was a flat stretch of highway when we heard a very loud booming bang like a gunshot. We pulled over to make sure that our backseat passenger, driver and driver side passenger were ok. We checked the outside, underneath and then noticed that the sunroof on top of the car had been damaged. On closer inspection the sun roof was shattered. We proceeded to drive and realized that the roof was noisy, so we pulled over immediately. We removed as much of the loose glass and proceeded on our way holding the sunroof door tightly so it wouldn\u2019t come open and rain any glass down on us. We took it to the dealer that we purchased the vehicle from two weeks before to inspect and repair, there were no warning lights or indications of the issue. We never saw any debris, there were no vehicles in front of us and only a motorcycle and one other vehicle pass in the oncoming lanes few seconds before the loud boom. This was a frightening and stressful situation, we thought we had bought a safe and state of the art car that we could safely drive without endangering us our passengers or other drivers.",

I found a safety issue where CarPlay is not playing audio output from any Maps (Apple/ Google/ Waze) if I\u2019m in on a call. Apple designed the Apple Maps to chime if anyone is in a call while using CarPlay. I brought up this issue on 5/25 to the dealer but was told it\u2019s an expected behavior. Not satisfied with the answer, I went to HondaConyersGA to do some digging and found that this issue doesn\u2019t apply to Android Auto and any lower trim (ie. Sport L). The issue is consistent across 2023-2025 CRV Touring trim. I went back to EdVoylesHonda service on [XXX] and [XXX] only to be discredited on my findings, and the service manager said that it might be a compatibility issue with Bose speakers. It was deemed normal since all Gen 6 Touring has the same behavior. I was also told that the turn-by-turn also plays on the screen and should be keeping an eye on the screen instead. This is disturbing because I\u2019m trying to limit my attention to the screen as much as possible, and sounds like a safety issue. A ticket was also opened with Honda Customer Service on 5/28, but haven\u2019t heard any statement or a path to move forward since the case manager said that they can only document the issue.

After car released to owner without addt'l testing, owner tested reverse automatic braking system. The system worked as expected - the car braked when it detected a close object in its field, it omitted the correct audible warning sounds and visual lights, and continued to perform when the driver depressed the braking system. Additionally, due to the newness of the car, the driver is extremely confident that no objects were around - the driver had been parking far from other vehicles to avoid dings. This \"computer glitch\" is potentially fatal as the car came to a sudden, complete stop while in motion and was unresponsive in any gear, even after brakes were applied and released.

    "summary": "I am filing a formal complaint regarding the safety systems on my 2025 Honda CR-V EX-L, particularly the overly aggressive Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) and intrusive Lane Keep Assist. While driving my children to school, my CR-V violently slammed the brakes because a scooter was creeping toward an intersection \u2014 clearly not entering traffic. The rider and I made eye contact, fully aware of each other, and there was an open left lane for evasive action if needed (it wasn't). Despite my clear judgment, the CMBS intervened, causing a violent deceleration that launched objects inside the vehicle, scared everyone, and increased the risk of a rear-end collision. I am shocked that Honda eliminated the hardware button to quickly disable CMBS. Now drivers must perform a multi-step procedure every time the vehicle starts \u2014 an unreasonable and unsafe burden. I previously owned a 2014 Accord and was a loyal, satisfied customer. I love nearly everything else about the CR-V, but these flawed \"safety\" systems are a potential deal-breaker. Sudden deceleration can cause concussions and greatly increase the chance of secondary accidents. Lane Keep Assist has created additional dangers. When I move slightly within my lane to create space from a semi-truck, the system unnecessarily corrects my steering. This is distracting and unsafe. Good drivers adjust dynamically, but these systems undermine good judgment rather than enhancing safety. Technology that overrides competent drivers is reckless, not \"intelligent.\" I request two changes: (1) Reinstate a hardware button to easily disable automatic emergency braking, and (2) Allow CMBS and Lane Keep Assist settings to persist across drives. Honda must redesign these systems with real-world driving in mind. Features that destroy driver trust are dangerous, not protective. I am deeply disappointed, frustrated, and have lost trust in my CR-V \u2014 a serious failure for a brand I once admired.",

I was driving with my 2025 Honda CRV and I noticed that the lane keep assist was having the ping pong affect when I first picked it up but I didn't really think too much about it. I assume my vehicle just needed some drive time since it was brand new and it was the first time it was on the highway. I noticed that this function was also causing the wheel to be very stiff. I know this system is a driving assistant and is not meant to take away from actual driving and paying attention to the road. But this week the system made an over correction and caused my vehicle turn into a guardrail on the highway. The road was straight, the day was clear and the lines on the lanes were very visible. There shouldn't have been an issue. I was pulled into the guardrail on the driver's side. I was with my girlfriend, her [XXX] son and my friend at the time. Everyone was a bit shaken up, I never had that happen before. It was primarily cosmetic damage to the vehicle and no other vehicles or property was damaged. I wasn't aware there was a steering recall on this vehicle until after the incident, and the recall was posted during the time I was finalizing the paperwork with my dealership for purchasing this vehicle. I haven't taken it to a dealership since getting the vehicle because they prepared everything prior to delivery or picking it up from the port in my case. I have filed a claim with my insurance company and hopefully the vehicle can be inspected for steering issues, to include the lane keep assist.

My [XXX] son and mother-in-law were in the back seat covered in glass. We are VERY fortunate that no one was injured from this, this seems to be a more common thing and should be addressed from Honda or the glass manufacturers. They need to look into a safer glass design so that this does not cause a bigger freak accident, especially on the freeway. We were also very fortunate that our local Honda dealership stepped up to replace it and offered a clear tint for the inside as protective insurance - just in case it happens again. They also provided us with a car until it was repaired. I did speak to a service writer about this and they said that there have been three other incidents at their dealership. I know there are other car manufacturers that are having problems with this too. This has made me very nervous about riding with my family-of-four with the sliding-shade open now.

The faster the speed, the worse the vibration is. You can visible see the mirror glass shaking. It is very dangerous at all times to not be able to see with this side mirror. It is especially dangerous on the highways because it distorts the view so greatly and also makes me feel disoriented and dizzy when I try to use it to safely navigate the roads. If the mirror glass were to fly off, this would lead to an even greater danger. Yes, this problem has been confirmed by a dealer. It has been brought to Saratoga Honda and they replaced the entire mirror unit. The second unit had the same defect, and did the same thing. They stated if they replaced it a third time, it would not make a difference. They also drove another CRV just like mine off the lot and the mirror did the same thing. This is an issue that needs to be turned into a recall. It is not okay that Honda produced vehicles with something so unsafe, with no ability to fix it.",

He stated that he was told by America Honda Motor Co , \"It is safe to drive the vehicle and that there is no danger of the steering seizing up to cause an accident\".

I found a safety issue where CarPlay is not playing audio output from any Maps (Apple/ Google/ Waze) if I\u2019m in on a call. Apple designed the Apple Maps to chime if anyone is in a call while using CarPlay. I brought up this issue on 5/25 to the dealer but was told it\u2019s an expected behavior. Not satisfied with the answer, I went to HondaConyersGA to do some digging and found that this issue doesn\u2019t apply to Android Auto and any lower trim (ie. Sport L). The issue is consistent across 2023-2025 CRV Touring trim. I went back to EdVoylesHonda service on [XXX] and [XXX] only to be discredited on my findings, and the service manager said that it might be a compatibility issue with Bose speakers. It was deemed normal since all Gen 6 Touring has the same behavior. I was also told that the turn-by-turn also plays on the screen and should be keeping an eye on the screen instead. This is disturbing because I\u2019m trying to limit my attention to the screen as much as possible, and sounds like a safety issue. A ticket was also opened with Honda Customer Service on 5/28, but haven\u2019t heard any statement or a path to move forward since the case manager said that they can only document the issue. Either Honda needs to take the car back and let me get a car that\u2019s working or have a commitment to resolve this issue.

To avoid active traffic while allowing enough room for the automatic doors to open safely, I moved as close to the Kia Carnival as possible with my [XXX] and infant in the stroller, engaging the safety breaks of the stroller. Due to the tight space, I underestimated the length the door needed to fully open by approximately 3 inches; this should not have been an issue as there is a sensor in the door that stops when it senses any object in its way. However, the sensor failed. The door did not stop when it came in to contact with the stroller that had my [XXX] baby in it. With the safety brakes engaged to prevent the stroller from rolling away, I desperately tried to drag away the locked stroller as quickly as possible. The door hit the stroller, continuing to open regardless of the object (my infant in her stroller) in the way, hooking the stroller on the lip of the door and pushing it up and over. If I did not have my hand on the stroller and acted so quickly, my daughter could have been seriously injured or worse. If the stroller had been facing the other way, I fear what would have happened. In addition, had it been my toddler standing there, she would have been crushed. I also endured bodily injury, physical strain, and mental anguish while keeping my children safe from this malfunction. I was in shock by the pure fear created by that situation. It was devastating. The door will not physically stop opening if you try to pull on it. The sensor does not work in detecting any body when opening. It needs physical force exerted against it, the size of an adult male to kick in. It is negligent. (Kia was already sued for this in previous models- they know it\u2019s an issue!)

The only thing that fixes the issue is literally pulling over and restarting the car, and then it drives fine.

To that, I said \u201cbut if the car thought there was something in front of us, it would have applied emergency braking, not just simply stopping any acceleration\u201d\u2026 to which they replied \u201cyeah I don\u2019t know.

One of the times it occurred, I went straight from a 25 mph city street onto a highway onramp that didn't have a safe place to pull off.

Joining the highway at 30mph was both illegal and unsafe and could have absolutely caused a fatal crash. ---- To troubleshoot this issue, we took it into the dealership and they didn't find any errors recorded or anything abnormal in diagnostics. They told us it was probably just a malfunctioning of the \"Auto Highway Speed Change\" setting that is intended to slow you down around curves when using cruise control on the highway. We told them that didn't make sense because it happened to us on city streets where that setting isn't even in play, but they insisted it was still the culprit and didn't investigate further.

    "summary": "In the general design of the Kia Carnival, among other vehicles from the same manufacture (i.e. Kia Sportage) and different manufacturers (i.e. Chevy Bolt), the false taillight cluster has created a safety issue when signaling. With specific mention of the turn signals being in the lower third of the vehicle height, and not in the taillamp cluster, drivers may not ever see the turn signals from the rear of the Kia Carnival, as most drivers are looking at the large taillamp cluster, not the bottom of the rear bumper for turn signals. The poor visibility is further enhanced when combined with the height or size of other vehicles (trucks with lift-kits, large front end vehicles, or large A-pillars) or poor driving from either the vehicle mentioned, or others. Attached photo taken from the Autopian [XXX] ) as a visual reference. No warning lamps appear, and no failures occurred, as it is normal function. This is a manufacturer-created/designed problem. I believe it was done intentionally by the manufacturers to circumvent other design limitations on signaling lamps not being placed on moving surfaces such as liftgates or trunks, and thus crated a new safety issue with large false taillamp clusters that are just the dim lights for illuminating the vehicle.

The subject vehicles are equipped with seat rails on the interior floor of the passenger compartment which allow for the adjustment of the 2nd -row seats. Under certain operating conditions in high temperature environments, the 2nd -row seat rails may become warm or hot to the touch. A hot seat rail can result in discomfort if an occupant touches the seat rail with their bare skin. This campaign is to install covers on the 2nd -row seat rails that reduce the surface temperature of the rails and improve the vehicle occupants\u2019 experience."

The vehicle has exhibited repeated, dangerous failures of its advanced driver assistance and braking systems that place both the driver and public at serious risk. Summary of Safety Incidents: First Incident: While driving at approximately 35 mph, the vehicle abruptly and uncommandedly stopped, with no driver input. Fortunately, there were no vehicles behind me at the time, or this could have resulted in a high-speed rear-end collision. Second Incident: Roughly 400 miles later, while stopped at a traffic light, the vehicle displayed multiple warning alerts and shut itself off completely. Upon restarting and driving approximately 50 yards, the braking system failed for about five seconds, rendering the truck unable to stop. This failure was later replicated by the authorized dealership\u2019s service team, who then informed me that the vehicle\u2019s CPU had failed during repair attempts. The vehicle has now been out of service for over 50 days, and the dealer has returned it to me twice in an unsafe condition. Stellantis, the vehicle manufacturer, has acknowledged the problem but has not provided a resolution.",

I was extremely lucky to not be in an accident as the vehicle was suddenly essentially undrivable while traveling at a high rate of speed. I was lucky to be able to get it to side of road safely but in different traffic conditions this likely would have caused an accident as it was impossible to increase speed, and extremely difficult to steer or brake. The car is at dealers for repairs. I suspect this is a failure of the PCM software and eTorque system similar to the recall put in place to 2019-2023 ETorque models with the V8 (mine is V6 and a 2025). THIS IS A HUGE DANGER AND RISK. With no warning the vehicle becomes undrivable while it is being driven!! Had I needed to stop quickly I could not. Had I needed to turn quickly to avoid something I could not.

I thought it was an alignment issue so i took it to the dealer for an alignment, they adjusted one parameter then gave me the alignment report showing that it's all fine. When i complained it still pulls to the right they took it in for a second service. That service the \"reprogrammed the steering module\" which is different from the prior model year. This made zero difference and the car still pulls to the right. It is annoying below 60 MPH where it essentially nudges you to the right and dangerous above 70MPH. I am in Texas and we have a local toll road with an 80MPH speed limit so the speeds i described are an everyday travel situation here, not speeding or being reckless. If i drive holding the wheel straight with one hand for example on a perfectly straight piece of road and let go of the wheel for less than a second to reposition my hand the car veers to the right. If i let go for 2 seconds at 65mph it leaves the lane I was curious how long it would take my other car to leave the lane, i did that experiment on the same road. It took 10 seconds before it even got close to the line. Same stretch of road, similar weather. This is not weather related. This behavior occurs at all times, various temperatures. In total i have about 1100 miles on the new car. I think this car needs an urgent mandatory recall and a stop sale.

Then at about 4,000 miles, my truck began running very erratically. Then soon after, my check engine light came on. I took it to a dealership for warranty repair. Their code scanner revealed several misfire codes along with other related codes. This issue seems to be very common for the 2025 RAM with the new twin turbo 6-cylinder engine as noted by many people in online vehicle groups for this truck that have same experience. RAM has acknowledged the issue but doesn\u2019t have a fix in almost 6 months later. My truck has been in service at the dealership for over 40 days and I have made several calls to check the status. Each time they say they cannot resolve. They say they have been in contact with the manufacturers \u201ctech line\u201d and have followed all their recommendations, but nothing has worked and there are no other resolutions available. There is nothing they can do. Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on, the truck cannot be used safely on the road due to erratic performance. Sometimes on the highway, maximum speed will drop to 40 mph. Misfire codes also present a problem with potential engine damage. Also, I am obviously worried about my state SAFETY inspection that is due in another 6 months that would certainly fail leaving me unable to legally operate the vehicle. Since this seems to be a mysterious issue that Stellantis/RAM is unable to understand, much less repair, I am worried about potential long-term issues with this truck.

At night, after turning my truck off - but without pressing the key fob, LOCK button, if I press the key fob UNLOCK button, the headlights and taillights come on (as per the featured settings) like they are supposed to do. However, if I press the key fob LOCK button first (1 or 2 presses - it doesn't matter), when I press the key fob UNLOCK button, the headlights and taillights do not turn on (as per the featured settings) like they are supposed to. Again, I believe this is a software issue, but could be related to the headlight module that I am seeing being reported online as well.",

I started noticing a noise coming from inside the dashboard and the check engine light came on. I kept driving as usual because i figured the light would go off. All of a sudden a big metal ring the size of my palm fell on my shoe and all the warning lights came on the dash ( the brake failure light, adaptive cruise control unavailable light, parking sensor failure light, check engine light, traction control malfunction light, brake system light, abs failure light). When i tried to brake, the brakes went all the way down and felt very spongy. I had to pump the brakes just so it would stop. So I pulled over into a parking spot turned off the truck and started it back up. The truck started up, but all the lights were still on. I tried to shift into drive but it wouldn't go in gear. I think is because the brake weren't going far enough to push whatever sensor allows the shifter to shift. I tried pumping the brakes and shifting and it worked. So i drove the truck home very carefully and parked it in my driveway. The next morning I called my sales man and left him a msg. He called me later that evening and asked me to bring it in on Monday morning. I did not use the truck during the weekend because it felt very unsafe to drive. On Monday morning i drove it to the dealership and left it there. They did give me a loaner vehicle. 2 days later I got a call from Dave the service manager and he let me know that the ring that fell on my foot holds a brake pedal in place and that they were going to replace the entire brake pedal assembly, the abs module, the brake booster and some ecm (i didn't understand which one). This truck has been unusable now for 7 days and I've only owned it for 13 days. It's been in the shop for 5 days now.

Take it to the dealer again where it\u2019s been sitting for the last week and a half. I get told today Chrysler has no fix for it and is closing the case and I can pick it up. I\u2019m sorry, what?? I\u2019m supposed to just take home a non correctly functioning $62,000 truck I haven\u2019t even made the 1st payment on? So it can what, strand me on the side of the road??",

A specific example is to review the instructions to engage the low range 4x4 function without damaging the truck or myself. Beginning with the 2025 model, RAM changed it's policy of providing one paper copy of the RAM 1500 Owner's Manual to the original owner upon request. As of today, a paper copy of the 2025 RAM 1500 Owner's Manual from RAM is unattainable. It is only available in an electronic format, and to people with computers and or smartphones with active internet access. RAM does not provide access to an Owner's Manual for their 2025 RAM 1500 to anyone who doesn't have a computer or smartphone. To access the Owner's Manual in my truck, I must download the RAM app on my Smartphone and maintain a good internet connection -- the RAM app will not open without a good internet connection. The other problem with this is that I am now required by RAM to always own a smart phone and purchase an internet service to view my Owner's Manual. I have owned the truck for less than three months with less that 1,000 miles, I have been unable to access my truck's operating instructions from the Owner's Manual at least three times. I have been in contact with RAM at least 4 times requesting a paper copy of the Owner's Manual, and been told they will not provide one. The solution to this problem is to return to their original policy of providing a paper copy upon request, OR add a PDF reading capability in the truck's onboard computer and load the manual into the onboard computer. Any assistance will be appreciated.",

The vehicle has exhibited repeated, dangerous failures of its advanced driver assistance and braking systems that place both the driver and public at serious risk. Summary of Safety Incidents: First Incident: While driving at approximately 35 mph, the vehicle abruptly and uncommandedly stopped, with no driver input. Fortunately, there were no vehicles behind me at the time, or this could have resulted in a high-speed rear-end collision. Second Incident: Roughly 400 miles later, while stopped at a traffic light, the vehicle displayed multiple warning alerts and shut itself off completely. Upon restarting and driving approximately 50 yards, the braking system failed for about five seconds, rendering the truck unable to stop. This failure was later replicated by the authorized dealership\u2019s service team, who then informed me that the vehicle\u2019s CPU had failed during repair attempts. The vehicle has now been out of service for over 50 days, and the dealer has returned it to me twice in an unsafe condition.

I thought it was an alignment issue so i took it to the dealer for an alignment, they adjusted one parameter then gave me the alignment report showing that it's all fine. When i complained it still pulls to the right they took it in for a second service. That service the \"reprogrammed the steering module\" which is different from the prior model year. This made zero difference and the car still pulls to the right. It is annoying below 60 MPH where it essentially nudges you to the right and dangerous above 70MPH. I am in Texas and we have a local toll road with an 80MPH speed limit so the speeds i described are an everyday travel situation here, not speeding or being reckless. If i drive holding the wheel straight with one hand for example on a perfectly straight piece of road and let go of the wheel for less than a second to reposition my hand the car veers to the right. If i let go for 2 seconds at 65mph it leaves the lane I was curious how long it would take my other car to leave the lane, i did that experiment on the same road. It took 10 seconds before it even got close to the line. Same stretch of road, similar weather. This is not weather related. This behavior occurs at all times, various temperatures. In total i have about 1100 miles on the new car. I think this car needs an urgent mandatory recall and a stop sale.

Then at about 4,000 miles, my truck began running very erratically. Then soon after, my check engine light came on. I took it to a dealership for warranty repair. Their code scanner revealed several misfire codes along with other related codes. This issue seems to be very common for the 2025 RAM with the new twin turbo 6-cylinder engine as noted by many people in online vehicle groups for this truck that have same experience. RAM has acknowledged the issue but doesn\u2019t have a fix in almost 6 months later. My truck has been in service at the dealership for over 40 days and I have made several calls to check the status. Each time they say they cannot resolve. They say they have been in contact with the manufacturers \u201ctech line\u201d and have followed all their recommendations, but nothing has worked and there are no other resolutions available. There is nothing they can do. Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on, the truck cannot be used safely on the road due to erratic performance. Sometimes on the highway, maximum speed will drop to 40 mph. Misfire codes also present a problem with potential engine damage. Also, I am obviously worried about my state SAFETY inspection that is due in another 6 months that would certainly fail leaving me unable to legally operate the vehicle. Since this seems to be a mysterious issue that Stellantis/RAM is unable to understand, much less repair, I am worried about potential long-term issues with this truck.

If it wasn't a feature, then I wouldn't have those options in my settings. I also discovered something interesting about this. At night, after turning my truck off - but without pressing the key fob, LOCK button, if I press the key fob UNLOCK button, the headlights and taillights come on (as per the featured settings) like they are supposed to do. However, if I press the key fob LOCK button first (1 or 2 presses - it doesn't matter), when I press the key fob UNLOCK button, the headlights and taillights do not turn on (as per the featured settings) like they are supposed to.

I started noticing a noise coming from inside the dashboard and the check engine light came on. I kept driving as usual because i figured the light would go off. All of a sudden a big metal ring the size of my palm fell on my shoe and all the warning lights came on the dash ( the brake failure light, adaptive cruise control unavailable light, parking sensor failure light, check engine light, traction control malfunction light, brake system light, abs failure light). When i tried to brake, the brakes went all the way down and felt very spongy. I had to pump the brakes just so it would stop. So I pulled over into a parking spot turned off the truck and started it back up. The truck started up, but all the lights were still on. I tried to shift into drive but it wouldn't go in gear. I think is because the brake weren't going far enough to push whatever sensor allows the shifter to shift. I tried pumping the brakes and shifting and it worked. So i drove the truck home very carefully and parked it in my driveway. The next morning I called my sales man and left him a msg. He called me later that evening and asked me to bring it in on Monday morning. I did not use the truck during the weekend because it felt very unsafe to drive. On Monday morning i drove it to the dealership and left it there. They did give me a loaner vehicle. 2 days later I got a call from Dave the service manager and he let me know that the ring that fell on my foot holds a brake pedal in place and that they were going to replace the entire brake pedal assembly, the abs module, the brake booster and some ecm (i didn't understand which one). This truck has been unusable now for 7 days and I've only owned it for 13 days. It's been in the shop for 5 days now.

A specific example is to review the instructions to engage the low range 4x4 function without damaging the truck or myself. Beginning with the 2025 model, RAM changed it's policy of providing one paper copy of the RAM 1500 Owner's Manual to the original owner upon request. As of today, a paper copy of the 2025 RAM 1500 Owner's Manual from RAM is unattainable. It is only available in an electronic format, and to people with computers and or smartphones with active internet access. RAM does not provide access to an Owner's Manual for their 2025 RAM 1500 to anyone who doesn't have a computer or smartphone. To access the Owner's Manual in my truck, I must download the RAM app on my Smartphone and maintain a good internet connection -- the RAM app will not open without a good internet connection. The other problem with this is that I am now required by RAM to always own a smart phone and purchase an internet service to view my Owner's Manual. I have owned the truck for less than three months with less that 1,000 miles, I have been unable to access my truck's operating instructions from the Owner's Manual at least three times. I have been in contact with RAM at least 4 times requesting a paper copy of the Owner's Manual, and been told they will not provide one. The solution to this problem is to return to their original policy of providing a paper copy upon request, OR add a PDF reading capability in the truck's onboard computer and load the manual into the onboard computer.

    "summary": "I am submitting this formal safety complaint regarding my 2025 RAM 1500 Limited, which I purchased new in November 2024 and currently with approximately 9,000 miles. The vehicle has exhibited repeated, dangerous failures of its advanced driver assistance and braking systems that place both the driver and public at serious risk. Summary of Safety Incidents: First Incident: While driving at approximately 35 mph, the vehicle abruptly and uncommandedly stopped, with no driver input. Fortunately, there were no vehicles behind me at the time, or this could have resulted in a high-speed rear-end collision. Second Incident: Roughly 400 miles later, while stopped at a traffic light, the vehicle displayed multiple warning alerts and shut itself off completely. Upon restarting and driving approximately 50 yards, the braking system failed for about five seconds, rendering the truck unable to stop. This failure was later replicated by the authorized dealership\u2019s service team, who then informed me that the vehicle\u2019s CPU had failed during repair attempts. The vehicle has now been out of service for over 50 days, and the dealer has returned it to me twice in an unsafe condition. Stellantis, the vehicle manufacturer, has acknowledged the problem but has not provided a resolution.",

    "summary": "When I first bought my truck, the engine had a surging problem at low idle when it was cold. Once it heated up, the problem went away, so I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. Then at about 4,000 miles, my truck began running very erratically. Then soon after, my check engine light came on. I took it to a dealership for warranty repair. Their code scanner revealed several misfire codes along with other related codes. This issue seems to be very common for the 2025 RAM with the new twin turbo 6-cylinder engine as noted by many people in online vehicle groups for this truck that have same experience. RAM has acknowledged the issue but doesn\u2019t have a fix in almost 6 months later. My truck has been in service at the dealership for over 40 days and I have made several calls to check the status. Each time they say they cannot resolve. They say they have been in contact with the manufacturers \u201ctech line\u201d and have followed all their recommendations, but nothing has worked and there are no other resolutions available. There is nothing they can do. Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on, the truck cannot be used safely on the road due to erratic performance. Sometimes on the highway, maximum speed will drop to 40 mph. Misfire codes also present a problem with potential engine damage. Also, I am obviously worried about my state SAFETY inspection that is due in another 6 months that would certainly fail leaving me unable to legally operate the vehicle. Since this seems to be a mysterious issue that Stellantis/RAM is unable to understand, much less repair, I am worried about potential long-term issues with this truck. Stellantis will not publicly state how many occurrences there are for this situation, but if online groups are any indication, it is a large number.",

I started noticing a noise coming from inside the dashboard and the check engine light came on. I kept driving as usual because i figured the light would go off. All of a sudden a big metal ring the size of my palm fell on my shoe and all the warning lights came on the dash ( the brake failure light, adaptive cruise control unavailable light, parking sensor failure light, check engine light, traction control malfunction light, brake system light, abs failure light). When i tried to brake, the brakes went all the way down and felt very spongy. I had to pump the brakes just so it would stop. So I pulled over into a parking spot turned off the truck and started it back up. The truck started up, but all the lights were still on. I tried to shift into drive but it wouldn't go in gear. I think is because the brake weren't going far enough to push whatever sensor allows the shifter to shift. I tried pumping the brakes and shifting and it worked. So i drove the truck home very carefully and parked it in my driveway. The next morning I called my sales man and left him a msg. He called me later that evening and asked me to bring it in on Monday morning. I did not use the truck during the weekend because it felt very unsafe to drive. On Monday morning i drove it to the dealership and left it there. They did give me a loaner vehicle. 2 days later I got a call from Dave the service manager and he let me know that the ring that fell on my foot holds a brake pedal in place and that they were going to replace the entire brake pedal assembly, the abs module, the brake booster and some ecm (i didn't understand which one).

This issue seems to be very common for the 2025 ram with the new twin turbo V6 engine where many people in vehicle groups for this truck all know about it. Ram has acknowledged the issue but doesn\u2019t have a fix almost 6 months later. I call the dealer monthly and they always say there is no fix. There is nothing they can do. Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on I cannot use things like my remote vehicle starter or utilize my app that I paid for. Misfire codes also present a problem with the engine, they can cause engine damage along with a reduction in power. Since the issue started so early in owning the vehicle it is hard to tell if any power reduction issues are present. I am obviously worried about my state inspection that is due in another 6 months and if this a potential fail I am also worried about potential long term issues with no fix from Ram. This problem has been happening since the release of this resigned model which now around 7-8 months with no fix.",

I drove it to Roanoke and stop to get gas and check the code for the check engine light which U1401. After filling up the check engine light went off. I took it to Shelor Motor Mile on Monday 11-04-2024. They put their diagnostic tool on it and it spit out 24 different codes. They had a backlog of appointments and could not even start to address the issue for 2 weeks. I took it to the dealership that I bought it from on Monday 11-11-2024.

A specific example is to review the instructions to engage the low range 4x4 function without damaging the truck or myself.

RAM does not provide access to an Owner's Manual for their 2025 RAM 1500 to anyone who doesn't have a computer or smartphone. To access the Owner's Manual in my truck, I must download the RAM app on my Smartphone and maintain a good internet connection -- the RAM app will not open without a good internet connection. The other problem with this is that I am now required by RAM to always own a smart phone and purchase an internet service to view my Owner's Manual. I have owned the truck for less than three months with less that 1,000 miles, I have been unable to access my truck's operating instructions from the Owner's Manual at least three times. I have been in contact with RAM at least 4 times requesting a paper copy of the Owner's Manual, and been told they will not provide one.

    "summary": "I am submitting this formal safety complaint regarding my 2025 RAM 1500 Limited, which I purchased new in November 2024 and currently with approximately 9,000 miles. The vehicle has exhibited repeated, dangerous failures of its advanced driver assistance and braking systems that place both the driver and public at serious risk. Summary of Safety Incidents: First Incident: While driving at approximately 35 mph, the vehicle abruptly and uncommandedly stopped, with no driver input. Fortunately, there were no vehicles behind me at the time, or this could have resulted in a high-speed rear-end collision. Second Incident: Roughly 400 miles later, while stopped at a traffic light, the vehicle displayed multiple warning alerts and shut itself off completely. Upon restarting and driving approximately 50 yards, the braking system failed for about five seconds, rendering the truck unable to stop. This failure was later replicated by the authorized dealership\u2019s service team, who then informed me that the vehicle\u2019s CPU had failed during repair attempts. The vehicle has now been out of service for over 50 days, and the dealer has returned it to me twice in an unsafe condition. Stellantis, the vehicle manufacturer, has acknowledged the problem but has not provided a resolution.",

    "summary": "Vehicle constantly pulls to the right. I thought it was an alignment issue so i took it to the dealer for an alignment, they adjusted one parameter then gave me the alignment report showing that it's all fine. When i complained it still pulls to the right they took it in for a second service. That service the \"reprogrammed the steering module\" which is different from the prior model year. This made zero difference and the car still pulls to the right. It is annoying below 60 MPH where it essentially nudges you to the right and dangerous above 70MPH. I am in Texas and we have a local toll road with an 80MPH speed limit so the speeds i described are an everyday travel situation here, not speeding or being reckless. If i drive holding the wheel straight with one hand for example on a perfectly straight piece of road and let go of the wheel for less than a second to reposition my hand the car veers to the right. If i let go for 2 seconds at 65mph it leaves the lane I was curious how long it would take my other car to leave the lane, i did that experiment on the same road. It took 10 seconds before it even got close to the line. Same stretch of road, similar weather. This is not weather related. This behavior occurs at all times, various temperatures. In total i have about 1100 miles on the new car. I think this car needs an urgent mandatory recall and a stop sale. This car should not have been sold to us in this condition this is unacceptable and unsafe. I found some threads online detailing this issue very similarly. Seems all the issues have different tolerances, but all about the same experience. [XXX] another thread. [XXX] Dealer says there is nothing else they can do until RAM issues a fix.

As I was turning into a parking lot to get somewhere safe the power to the truck turned off, and I lost power steering. Truck came to a stop in a parking but I was blocking traffic. Tow truck driver was able to jump the battery to get it onto a tow truck. I had the vehicle towed back to the dealer. They scanned the truck, and there were alot of codes thrown. They have been talking to Stellantis Engineers to figure out the problem. I was told by dealer that for certain it is a broken wire causing the batteries not to charge. That wasn't it. I am now being told it is the battery control module, and they have ordered parts. I have checked ram forums, and there are a lot of people reporting similar issues of brand new trucks dying within a few hundred miles of purchasing. replacing the batteries, and alternators.

    "summary": "When I first bought my truck, the engine had a surging problem at low idle when it was cold. Once it heated up, the problem went away, so I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. Then at about 4,000 miles, my truck began running very erratically. Then soon after, my check engine light came on. I took it to a dealership for warranty repair. Their code scanner revealed several misfire codes along with other related codes. This issue seems to be very common for the 2025 RAM with the new twin turbo 6-cylinder engine as noted by many people in online vehicle groups for this truck that have same experience. RAM has acknowledged the issue but doesn\u2019t have a fix in almost 6 months later. My truck has been in service at the dealership for over 40 days and I have made several calls to check the status. Each time they say they cannot resolve. They say they have been in contact with the manufacturers \u201ctech line\u201d and have followed all their recommendations, but nothing has worked and there are no other resolutions available. There is nothing they can do. Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on, the truck cannot be used safely on the road due to erratic performance. Sometimes on the highway, maximum speed will drop to 40 mph. Misfire codes also present a problem with potential engine damage. Also, I am obviously worried about my state SAFETY inspection that is due in another 6 months that would certainly fail leaving me unable to legally operate the vehicle. Since this seems to be a mysterious issue that Stellantis/RAM is unable to understand, much less repair, I am worried about potential long-term issues with this truck. Stellantis will not publicly state how many occurrences there are for this situation, but if online groups are any indication, it is a large number.",

I started noticing a noise coming from inside the dashboard and the check engine light came on. I kept driving as usual because i figured the light would go off. All of a sudden a big metal ring the size of my palm fell on my shoe and all the warning lights came on the dash ( the brake failure light, adaptive cruise control unavailable light, parking sensor failure light, check engine light, traction control malfunction light, brake system light, abs failure light). When i tried to brake, the brakes went all the way down and felt very spongy. I had to pump the brakes just so it would stop. So I pulled over into a parking spot turned off the truck and started it back up. The truck started up, but all the lights were still on. I tried to shift into drive but it wouldn't go in gear. I think is because the brake weren't going far enough to push whatever sensor allows the shifter to shift. I tried pumping the brakes and shifting and it worked. So i drove the truck home very carefully and parked it in my driveway. The next morning I called my sales man and left him a msg. He called me later that evening and asked me to bring it in on Monday morning. I did not use the truck during the weekend because it felt very unsafe to drive. On Monday morning i drove it to the dealership and left it there. They did give me a loaner vehicle. 2 days later I got a call from Dave the service manager and he let me know that the ring that fell on my foot holds a brake pedal in place and that they were going to replace the entire brake pedal assembly, the abs module, the brake booster and some ecm (i didn't understand which one). This truck has been unusable now for 7 days and I've only owned it for 13 days. It's been in the shop for 5 days now.

Misfire codes also present a problem with the engine, they can cause engine damage along with a reduction in power. Since the issue started so early in owning the vehicle it is hard to tell if any power reduction issues are present. I am obviously worried about my state inspection that is due in another 6 months and if this a potential fail I am also worried about potential long term issues with no fix from Ram.

Occasionally this is with enough force that the signal will stay on, but it is usually only with force sufficient to tap the other signal and register only 2-3 blinks before stopping. This is a safety issue because it looks like erratic signaling behavior to those outside of the vehicle. When travelling on busy highways at speeds exceeding 60mph erratic signaling of this kind can confuse other drivers and lead to collisions. It can make other drivers think you are driving erratically (like changing lanes only to double back into the lane you came from) or to try to pass you rapidly just to escape a driver that is signaling strangely. This has been confirmed on many Equinox EVs, both '24 and '25 model years. This does not trigger any sort of errors, warnings, chimes or alerts. It simply excessively triggers the turn signals outside of when you would want them actuated. The fix is just to tweak the turn signal resistance to be more like other vehicles.

Upon researching online, there are hundreds of reports with thousands of people commenting. A company now even makes a dashboard mat to reduce the glare issue. I have not been able to take a good picture that adequately demonstrates the issue so I am attaching one from someone who was able to take a photo of what it looks like to the human eye. I am convinced that this situation warrants a recall.",

    "summary": "The 2024-2025 Chevy Equinox EV has a major safety issue with overwhelming windshield reflections/glare caused by the odd design choices of the sculpted dash. The dash of the car has a slotted design unlike any I have seen in any other car, including other Chevy models currently available at Chevrolet dealerships. This slotted design creates numerous surfaces across the entire width of the dash that easily reflect the light thus producing a horrible glare on the windshield. I first noticed this issue within minutes of my first test driving a '24 model back in May 2024, something the salesperson had claimed to be unaware of but quickly conceded it was bad. As we changed direction the problem subsided and he felt it was probably only a rare issue. I finally took delivery of a '25 model on 01/16/25 & discovered that the issue persists more frequently than expected & is bad enough to block a clear view of what is in front of the vehicle. The problem is worse during bright, sunny days & from certain angles to the sun, but I have also noticed it on cloud covered days as well. It has been suggested that I use polarized glasses to mitigate the issue, & they do help, but they create other issues such as clearly seeing controls inside the car or viewing the rearview mirror as they darken everything. I am concerned that at some point, when the reflections are very bad, that I will not see a car backing out of a space in front of me or a pedestrian starting to walk out in front of me. It's unbelievable Chevy did not recognize this issue & address it at some point during all their testing before releasing this car for sale. I have found that this issue is a huge problem for many others & vehicle specific forums online are full of people having the same bad experience. I in fact acquired the link to this form from someone in those forums who was also having this issue. Something needs to be done by Chevy to fix this before someone is seriously hurt or worse.",

Occasionally this is with enough force that the signal will stay on, but it is usually only with force sufficient to tap the other signal and register only 2-3 blinks before stopping. This is a safety issue because it looks like erratic signaling behavior to those outside of the vehicle. When travelling on busy highways at speeds exceeding 60mph erratic signaling of this kind can confuse other drivers and lead to collisions. It can make other drivers think you are driving erratically (like changing lanes only to double back into the lane you came from) or to try to pass you rapidly just to escape a driver that is signaling strangely. This has been confirmed on many Equinox EVs, both '24 and '25 model years. This does not trigger any sort of errors, warnings, chimes or alerts. It simply excessively triggers the turn signals outside of when you would want them actuated. The fix is just to tweak the turn signal resistance to be more like other vehicles.

This inconvenience is extremely annoying, frustrating, and most importantly, very dangerous.

This is a cornerstone advantage of the EV in general, and needs to work 100% of the time, just as my money is taken every month 100% of the time. This also results in other critical features being disabled, such as the auto-hold and forward collision systems. I believe it also impacts the cruise control as well.

I've heard about the recall, and subsequent remedy, but I'm not satisfied with that, as the issue could occur again. I've lost faith in the vehicle and need to get rid of it. How can you help me do so. Thanks. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

    "summary": "The 2024-2025 Chevy Equinox EV has a major safety issue with overwhelming windshield reflections/glare caused by the odd design choices of the sculpted dash. The dash of the car has a slotted design unlike any I have seen in any other car, including other Chevy models currently available at Chevrolet dealerships. This slotted design creates numerous surfaces across the entire width of the dash that easily reflect the light thus producing a horrible glare on the windshield. I first noticed this issue within minutes of my first test driving a '24 model back in May 2024, something the salesperson had claimed to be unaware of but quickly conceded it was bad. As we changed direction the problem subsided and he felt it was probably only a rare issue. I finally took delivery of a '25 model on 01/16/25 & discovered that the issue persists more frequently than expected & is bad enough to block a clear view of what is in front of the vehicle. The problem is worse during bright, sunny days & from certain angles to the sun, but I have also noticed it on cloud covered days as well. It has been suggested that I use polarized glasses to mitigate the issue, & they do help, but they create other issues such as clearly seeing controls inside the car or viewing the rearview mirror as they darken everything. I am concerned that at some point, when the reflections are very bad, that I will not see a car backing out of a space in front of me or a pedestrian starting to walk out in front of me. It's unbelievable Chevy did not recognize this issue & address it at some point during all their testing before releasing this car for sale. I have found that this issue is a huge problem for many others & vehicle specific forums online are full of people having the same bad experience. I in fact acquired the link to this form from someone in those forums who was also having this issue. Something needs to be done by Chevy to fix this before someone is seriously hurt or worse.",

The other position is the \u201cflick\u201d that flashes the signal 3 times and turns it off on its own. When I set my turn signal to the regular on position to turn right, after I complete my turn the signal turns itself off and goes into the default off position. However when returning itself into the off position, it ends up going into the \u201cflick\u201d position for left turn. The signal then flashes left 3 times and turns off. So to summarize, after turning right while using the turn signal, it flicks itself into the left turn position. This is distracting to me while driving and may confuse other drivers as well. I took it into the dealer for this issue and they said they could not replicate it. No warning lights or anything like that. I have video proof of this happening",

There were no barriers immediately in front of me, as in a hard curve left or right and definitely no vehicle in front of me and thankfully no vehicle behind me, considering the normal bumper-to-bumper morning traffic. I did not come to a complete stop, well I don't think I did, but slowed greatly enough that all vehicles on my left driving past me fairly fast. I was in shock and confused unable to figure out happened. After a brief assessment of my surrounding I accelerated and continued on my way to work. If someone has been following me I have no doubt they would have collided with me, worse it could have been a tractor trailer! I got to work and was mentally shot for the rest of the day. The dealer was friendly, somewhat empathetic and I scheduled a maintenance check up. I have owned the car less than one month of this this report. I am already looking for a new vehicle and will NEVER own a Honda again. Driving this vehicle with that CMBS that can go off randomly, a/k/a \"phantom brake\" is nerve raking. I do my best to remember disable the system before driving. Sadly, a system I would ordinarily enjoy having. Also, I now fear following other Honda drivers because if their CMBS fail I might crash into them! The idea Honda has not repaired this or a recalled their vehicles is mind bending; this could cause fatalities! Frankly, their complacency is nothing short of apathy for human life.

    "summary": "Subject: Safety Complaint Regarding Adaptive Cruise Control Malfunction \u2013 2025 Honda Pilot Dear NHTSA Office of Defects Investigation, I am filing a formal complaint regarding a recurring safety issue with my 2025 Honda Pilot, which I purchased in September 2024. The vehicle\u2019s Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system frequently and unexpectedly turns off while driving on the highway, creating a serious road safety hazard. This issue has been happening intermittently since I bought the vehicle, and despite bringing it to Honda\u2019s attention, they have not acknowledged or addressed the problem. The sudden deactivation of the ACC system can cause unexpected speed changes, forcing the driver to react quickly and potentially leading to hazardous driving conditions. Given the increasing reliance on driver-assist technologies, such malfunctions pose a risk to both the driver and other motorists on the road. I have reported this issue to my local Honda dealership, but they have not provided a permanent resolution. I am concerned that other Honda Pilot owners may be experiencing the same problem, which could indicate a widespread defect. Therefore, I urge the NHTSA to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action, including issuing a recall if necessary, to prevent potential accidents. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and inform me of any next steps. I am available to provide further details or documentation as needed. I appreciate your prompt attention to this critical safety concern. I also attached photos of the said issue. Sincerely, [XXX] INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

On January 5, 2025, while inspecting the engine, I noticed that the protective cover on the wiring harness was wrapped with black electrical tape. This tape was shredded and peeling away from the plastic pipe cover, likely due to heat or other factors. I was surprised and concerned to find such a low-quality material used in this location. The tape's deterioration raises concerns about potential damage to the wiring itself due to heat exposure. I am also worried about the long-term reliability and safety implications, including the possibility of a fire. I drove approximately 40 miles round trip to the Honda dealership where I purchased the vehicle. They dismissed my concerns, stating that this was \"normal\" and simply advised me to purchase more electrical tape from a home improvement store and re-wrap the harness myself. They refused to perform any repair or replacement. I question why Honda would not use heat-resistant tape in this engine compartment area, especially given the potential for high temperatures. Using a more robust, heat-resistant material would provide greater safety and prevent the current issue. I believe this is a design flaw that needs to be addressed.",

This happened the first time with only 100 miles on the vehicle. My concern for safety is that sudden unexpected braking could cause an accident and lead to potential injury/death. I've had the vehicle to the dealership 5 times and they've had a handful of excuses. First the alignment of the car was off. Next was a replacement of the radar unit, which they believed to be faulty. The next visits resulted in my Honda tech telling me that a \"large radio tower\" near where I live are causing interference with the system. However when I received the paper work it says there are large power lines causing interference. I live in a small town and there are no large power lines or large radio towers visible from where I live. I believe Honda is making excuses to get me to stop bothering them with this issue. After all of these trips, Honda is refusing to look at the vehicle again, despite it's behavior putting myself and my family at risk.

    "summary": "While driving on an open road, two lanes traveling the same direction the collision mitigation system was activated. The only thing I can think is that it was due to a bicycle that was traveling the same direction at a slower speed than I was driving but I had plenty of room to go around and was not even close to hitting them. The brakes were activated which was not only scary but dangerous. Had a car been behind me there is a strong chance I would have been rear-ended because nobody in their right mind would expect me to hit my brakes in this situation. This prompted me to look at the manual where I saw Honda has a list of reasons the emergency braking could activate despite \"little chance of collision\". The list is extensive with many reasons the system could activate incorrectly causing an accident, not preventing one. The unexpected braking itself is terrifying but how difficult Honda makes it to \"opt out\" of the system that obviously has many flaws is even more concerning. I tried to turn off this system only to find out that it is a multi step process that can only be done when stopped so if you forget to turn it off you are stuck using it even if you don't trust the system. Every other safety setting can be turned off while driving except this one. Why make it so difficult for the driver to choose to have complete control of their car, especially when their system is admittedly flawed. In addition, the emergency braking system is the only safety feature that resets every time you shut off the car. So every single time you start the engine you have to go through multiple steps to choose to have control of your own vehicle. It seems the system that is the most flawed is the only one Honda is trying to force drivers to use. This is not safe for my family or those driving around me. I called Honda and they told me there is nothing that can be done to disable it and have the setting hold even after turning off the car like all the other safety setting.",

    "summary": "New 2025 Pilot with about 3,000 miles, driving in Montana on a level dusty gravel road at about 5,000 feet altitude. Driving into the morning sun for about 20 minutes at a slow speed of about 30 mph all of a sudden multiple warnings flashed, engine, brakes, etc. Steering was stiff and brakes did not feel active, very stiff. I just coasted to a stop on a desolate gravel road, no other traffic. The engine was still running, did not press on the gas for in large red letters the warning panel said \"DO NOT DRIVE\". The car was very dusty. If we had been on an Interstate at 70 mph that would have been an accident, with steering and brakes inhibited somehow? I shut OFF the engine, waited 10 minutes, started engine again and WARNINGS still active. Shut OFF engine and waited 20 minutes. Restarted engine and looked like warning were starting to clear, and steering and brakes felt normal again. With no WARNINGS showing I drove very slowly for many miles with no further occurrences. Slowly worked my way back across the country to Florida without any further failures. It appears to all be computer related, perhaps sensors failing and the computer shutting down what must be electrical steering and brake assist. At speeds with Interstate traffic, that condition will be an accident. There are no failure codes shown on the access panel. We have an appointment with our Honda service dealer, maybe they will be able to access a computer history to see the failure mode that caused loss of steering and brakes. The fact that a computer can impact those critical systems on a vehicle, is a serious safety issue. Prior to this incident, driving about 30 minutes on a dusty gravel road in Montana, some sensor must have been actuating the rear brake caliper, I could hear the scraping sound of pad on rotor, didn't sense the car slowing. The car was dusty, maybe sensors inhibited, the scraping lasted about 15 minutes, at least that it could be heard in the car. Could be a safety iss",

I was in a construction zone and I was probably traveling about 50 miles per hour. There were no barriers immediately in front of me, as in a hard curve left or right and definitely no vehicle in front of me and thankfully no vehicle behind me, considering the normal bumper-to-bumper morning traffic. I did not come to a complete stop, well I don't think I did, but slowed greatly enough that all vehicles on my left driving past me fairly fast. I was in shock and confused unable to figure out happened. After a brief assessment of my surrounding I accelerated and continued on my way to work. If someone has been following me I have no doubt they would have collided with me, worse it could have been a tractor trailer! I got to work and was mentally shot for the rest of the day. The dealer was friendly, somewhat empathetic and I scheduled a maintenance check up. I have owned the car less than one month of this this report. I am already looking for a new vehicle and will NEVER own a Honda again. Driving this vehicle with that CMBS that can go off randomly, a/k/a \"phantom brake\" is nerve raking. I do my best to remember disable the system before driving. Sadly, a system I would ordinarily enjoy having. Also, I now fear following other Honda drivers because if their CMBS fail I might crash into them! The idea Honda has not repaired this or a recalled their vehicles is mind bending; this could cause fatalities! Frankly, their complacency is nothing short of apathy for human life. I am going to lose thousands of dollars getting out of this vehicle, which I find unacceptable and cruel.

    "summary": "Subject: Safety Complaint Regarding Adaptive Cruise Control Malfunction \u2013 2025 Honda Pilot Dear NHTSA Office of Defects Investigation, I am filing a formal complaint regarding a recurring safety issue with my 2025 Honda Pilot, which I purchased in September 2024. The vehicle\u2019s Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system frequently and unexpectedly turns off while driving on the highway, creating a serious road safety hazard. This issue has been happening intermittently since I bought the vehicle, and despite bringing it to Honda\u2019s attention, they have not acknowledged or addressed the problem. The sudden deactivation of the ACC system can cause unexpected speed changes, forcing the driver to react quickly and potentially leading to hazardous driving conditions. Given the increasing reliance on driver-assist technologies, such malfunctions pose a risk to both the driver and other motorists on the road. I have reported this issue to my local Honda dealership, but they have not provided a permanent resolution. I am concerned that other Honda Pilot owners may be experiencing the same problem, which could indicate a widespread defect. Therefore, I urge the NHTSA to investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action, including issuing a recall if necessary, to prevent potential accidents. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and inform me of any next steps. I am available to provide further details or documentation as needed. I appreciate your prompt attention to this critical safety concern. I also attached photos of the said issue. Sincerely, [XXX] INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

On January 5, 2025, while inspecting the engine, I noticed that the protective cover on the wiring harness was wrapped with black electrical tape. This tape was shredded and peeling away from the plastic pipe cover, likely due to heat or other factors. I was surprised and concerned to find such a low-quality material used in this location. The tape's deterioration raises concerns about potential damage to the wiring itself due to heat exposure. I am also worried about the long-term reliability and safety implications, including the possibility of a fire. I drove approximately 40 miles round trip to the Honda dealership where I purchased the vehicle. They dismissed my concerns, stating that this was \"normal\" and simply advised me to purchase more electrical tape from a home improvement store and re-wrap the harness myself. They refused to perform any repair or replacement. I question why Honda would not use heat-resistant tape in this engine compartment area, especially given the potential for high temperatures. Using a more robust, heat-resistant material would provide greater safety and prevent the current issue. I believe this is a design flaw that needs to be addressed.",

The only thing I can think is that it was due to a bicycle that was traveling the same direction at a slower speed than I was driving but I had plenty of room to go around and was not even close to hitting them. The brakes were activated which was not only scary but dangerous. Had a car been behind me there is a strong chance I would have been rear-ended because nobody in their right mind would expect me to hit my brakes in this situation. This prompted me to look at the manual where I saw Honda has a list of reasons the emergency braking could activate despite \"little chance of collision\". The list is extensive with many reasons the system could activate incorrectly causing an accident, not preventing one. The unexpected braking itself is terrifying but how difficult Honda makes it to \"opt out\" of the system that obviously has many flaws is even more concerning. I tried to turn off this system only to find out that it is a multi step process that can only be done when stopped so if you forget to turn it off you are stuck using it even if you don't trust the system. Every other safety setting can be turned off while driving except this one. Why make it so difficult for the driver to choose to have complete control of their car, especially when their system is admittedly flawed. In addition, the emergency braking system is the only safety feature that resets every time you shut off the car. So every single time you start the engine you have to go through multiple steps to choose to have control of your own vehicle. It seems the system that is the most flawed is the only one Honda is trying to force drivers to use. This is not safe for my family or those driving around me. I called Honda and they told me there is nothing that can be done to disable it and have the setting hold even after turning off the car like all the other safety setting.",

Driving into the morning sun for about 20 minutes at a slow speed of about 30 mph all of a sudden multiple warnings flashed, engine, brakes, etc. Steering was stiff and brakes did not feel active, very stiff. I just coasted to a stop on a desolate gravel road, no other traffic. The engine was still running, did not press on the gas for in large red letters the warning panel said \"DO NOT DRIVE\". The car was very dusty. If we had been on an Interstate at 70 mph that would have been an accident, with steering and brakes inhibited somehow? I shut OFF the engine, waited 10 minutes, started engine again and WARNINGS still active. Shut OFF engine and waited 20 minutes. Restarted engine and looked like warning were starting to clear, and steering and brakes felt normal again. With no WARNINGS showing I drove very slowly for many miles with no further occurrences. Slowly worked my way back across the country to Florida without any further failures. It appears to all be computer related, perhaps sensors failing and the computer shutting down what must be electrical steering and brake assist. At speeds with Interstate traffic, that condition will be an accident. There are no failure codes shown on the access panel. We have an appointment with our Honda service dealer, maybe they will be able to access a computer history to see the failure mode that caused loss of steering and brakes. The fact that a computer can impact those critical systems on a vehicle, is a serious safety issue. Prior to this incident, driving about 30 minutes on a dusty gravel road in Montana, some sensor must have been actuating the rear brake caliper, I could hear the scraping sound of pad on rotor, didn't sense the car slowing. The car was dusty, maybe sensors inhibited, the scraping lasted about 15 minutes, at least that it could be heard in the car. Could be a safety iss",

The dealership told me because I filed a complaint with GM they can't touch it unless directed by GM now. It almost knocked me out, I saw black and was hard to see for at first within a few hours it was a huge goose egg on my head. It put me and my 6yr old at risk as she was with me but luckily in the car already. When approaching my car I used the liftgate remote to open it ahead of time, got my daughter in car and went to put our backpacks in the back when it crashed on my head full force no warning. It was extremely painful and caused a concussion with multiple symptoms. Headaches, painful bump, ear ringing, feeling so hot, major brain fog, forgetfulness, watery eyes, feeling really tired and hard to wake up in the morning. It has been about 3 weeks and the symptoms are mostly gone except bad ear ringing, light sensativity, on and off headaches easily, can't put my hair in ponytail as it hurts still. I still have a small dent in my head. The doc says these lasting concussion symptoms could last for months. I don't understand why this has problem has not been fixed when research shows it has been a problem since 2010. The only other issue I had with the car was my instrument panel going black while I was driving a few weeks prior.",

    "summary": "I recently purchased a 2025 Equinox EV LT1 vehicle. Overall, the vehicle is performing well and has a number of safety features that are helpful when driving. As others have also reported, the windshield glare on this vehicle is a weak spot, and without polarized sunglasses, the glare is often severe and distracting. At night, the use of sunglasses is of course not feasible, and occasional glare from headlights and streetlights can compromise the driver's ability to view the road and surroundings. Aftermarket dash covers are available, and that may be what I have to resort to to address the problem until/unless a recall or remedy is available from GM directly. This may seem more like an annoyance than a significant safety issue, but when you are unable to clearly view the environment around you when driving, it is a real problem.",

The steering seems to lock into a position so while approaching a curve you're unable to steer toward the center of the lane, requiring you to jerk the steering wheel towards the center of the lane to prevent going out of the lane. This issue was reported and taken to multiple GM dealerships to address and they keep insisting it's Lane keep assist, it is not as this issue happens when it's turned of, further more lane keep assist usually nudges a vehicle back in lane or vibrates to warn you're drifting out of a lane. It does not actively try to pull you out of a lane as We've experienced with this car. This is a deadly hazard that may cause an inattentive drive to over steer into an accident, and because of it's intermittent nature, It will be surprising and scary causing less experienced drivers to overreact to it. I'm afraid this may be a latent safety fault within the 2025 Chevy Equinox, that will eventually cost lives, and worst part, this cause may not be detected for a long time.. I hope more instances of this gets reported to force GM and it's dealerships to spend the proper effort to hunt down this safety issue and address it before it's too late",

The steering seems to lock into a position so while approaching a curve you're unable to steer toward the center of the lane, requiring you to jerk the steering wheel towards the center of the lane to prevent going out of the lane. This issue was reported and taken to multiple GM dealerships to address and they keep insisting it's Lane keep assist, it is not as this issue happens when it's turned of, further more lane keep assist usually nudges a vehicle back in lane or vibrates to warn you're drifting out of a lane. It does not actively try to pull you out of a lane as We've experienced with this car. This is a deadly hazard that may cause an inattentive drive to over steer into an accident, and because of it's intermittent nature, It will be surprising and scary causing less experienced drivers to overreact to it. I'm afraid this may be a latent safety fault within the 2025 Chevy Equinox, that will eventually cost lives, and worst part, this cause may not be detected for a long time..

In the middle of jam-packed, six-lane freeways with vehicles traveling at 70 mph or more the Tucson would beep-beep-beep and say \"Keep your eyes on the road.\" But, of course, the driver's eyes were on the road. Then the system would take control and slow the car down to 30 mph or so, creating a terrifying and highly dangerous situation. And this is supposed to be a safey sytem. The system obviously was not properly tested in real-life road situations. Apparently, the height of the driver's eyes, their arm position while holding the wheel, whether they're wearing sunglasses . . . all sorts of factors seem to confuse the system and cause it to act when it should do nothing. I have turned off all the driver assistance warnings possible, but it makes no difference. And other drivers report having the same issues--unwarranted, dangerous reactions by the car that cannot be stopped by turning the driver assistance features off.

    "summary": "CrashYes FireNo Injuries0 Deaths0 I am filing a complaint regarding a serious safety malfunction in my 2025 Hyundai Tucson\u2019s forward collision sensor, which caused an accident. I have owned this vehicle for only two weeks, and I believe this issue poses a risk to myself and other drivers. On February 25, 2025, while driving, the car in front of me stopped and made a U-turn. There was no imminent risk of collision, yet my Tucson\u2019s forward collision sensor erroneously activated and engaged the automatic braking system. This caused my vehicle to come to an abrupt stop, resulting in a rear-end collision. I have documented the incident, including photographs, a police report, and insurance documentation, which I can provide upon request. This malfunction is extremely concerning, as a feature designed to prevent accidents instead directly caused one. If this issue exists in other Hyundai Tucson vehicles, it presents a severe hazard for drivers. I urge NHTSA to investigate this as a potential safety defect, determine if other similar complaints exist, and assess whether Hyundai needs to issue a recall or software fix. I also need guidance on whether there are any known remedies or if I should take my vehicle to the dealership for inspection. This issue must be addressed before it leads to more accidents.

    "summary": "The 2025 Hyundai Tucson's Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system does not operate properly due to either a design flaw or a flawed implementation of the design. Hyundai's integration of Forward Attention Warning (FAW) with the ACC prohibits the driver from using ACC while wearing sunglasses. If one is driving the vehicle with ACC engaged and puts on sunglasses, the FAW flashes a warning on the dashboard and disengages the ACC. In order to engage cruise control the driver must interact with the onboard video display system to switch from ACC to \"dumb cruise\". Obviously the driver's attention is distracted while manipulating the selection of cruise control. The driver is also forced to compromise driving safety because they are forced to choose between wearing sunglasses and being able to use ACC. Use of ACC enhances safety especially when driving into the sun or in low visibility situations. The incompatibility of ACC with sunglasses wear then compromises safety. To make matters worse the FAW options screen provides erroneous information. It indicates that the driver can turn off FAW, but turning it off does not in fact turn it off. Turning it off stops the FAW warnings only until the driver turns on and engages ACC at which time ACC apparently forces FAW back on and active. I took the problem to my local Hyundai dealer who confirmed the problem and indicated they could not repair the problem. Since I am considering a Georgia Lemon Law claim, I asked whether I needed to bring the car back since the lemon law gives the dealer/manufacturer 3 tries to fix the problem. The dealer indicated that would be a waste of time because Hyundai will not support/allow the issue to be corrected. The dealer indicated this is a known issue. An Internet search also confirms that Hyundai's FAW + ACC integration is flawed. Additionally it is not clear whether other enhanced vehicle safety systems such as automatic emergency braking are compromised by the wearing of sunglasses?",

It was difficult to see through the windshield. We also noticed the same defect on the other windows, however, not as bad. We contacted the dealership and subsequently brought it into their service center for inspection. They confirmed the visibility defect and ordered a new factory replacement windshield and installed it. The replacement windshield, while not perfectly clear of spots, was acceptable for safe driving. The original windshield had such poor visibility in certain conditions that it would be hard to see anything, which would be hazardous while driving. We took possession of the car after the windshield replacement was completed but still feel that the spots on the other windows are a manufacturing defect but do not necessarily create a hazard. Along with employees of Earnhardt dealership, we looked at other brand new 2025 Hyundai vehicles of varying makes and models and observed the same windshield defect in many of the cars we looked at on their sales lot. This does not appear to be an isolated incident, but the dealership said that we were the first customers to bring it to their attention.

The system obviously was not properly tested in real-life road situations. Apparently, the height of the driver's eyes, their arm position while holding the wheel, whether they're wearing sunglasses . . . all sorts of factors seem to confuse the system and cause it to act when it should do nothing.

I have documented the incident, including photographs, a police report, and insurance documentation, which I can provide upon request. This malfunction is extremely concerning, as a feature designed to prevent accidents instead directly caused one. If this issue exists in other Hyundai Tucson vehicles, it presents a severe hazard for drivers. I urge NHTSA to investigate this as a potential safety defect, determine if other similar complaints exist, and assess whether Hyundai needs to issue a recall or software fix.
